        "content": "Welcome to 2.854.1x Introduction to Manufacturing Systems Engineering. This is the second module in our new Principles of Manufacturing MicroMasters program, and while our focus here is on the topic of randomness and variation in manufacturing settings, we urge you to look at the complete set of modules in the MicroMasters, which all revolve around the theme of flow (of material and information) and variation at various levels of manufacturing. \n\nIf you're new to edX we highly encourage you to view DemoX to learn about the edX learning experience.\n\nThere will be one timed exam in this course - be sure to block out your schedule accordingly. The final exam will be released on May 29 and must be completed prior to June 5. This date, as well as all due dates for the weekly Graded Problem Sets are fixed and cannot be changed or modified for any individuals, please plan accordingly.\n\nWhat to Expect from 2.854.1x:\nThis course will follow a weekly program for a total of 7 weeks. Each week, you will receive new lecture videos, finger exercises and a homework assignment (except for week 1) as we build toward the final exam. The best way you can prepare for the course now is to ensure that you have adequate time scheduled in the coming weeks to complete the course.\n\nWhat You'll Learn:\n\nProbability Basics\nStochastic Processes\nQueuing Theory\nInventory Management\nToyota Production System\nSingle Part Type Manufacturing Lines\n\n\nCertificate of Achievement:\nWe hope you want to learn for the sake of learning, but you can get additional value for your career by purchasing a verified certificate. You must be registered as Verified by no later than May 3rd - no exceptions. Here are a few reasons to consider upgrading to a verified certificate. \n\n\n\nProvides solid proof of your achievement\nLooks great on your resume when applying for new jobs or that next promotion\nWorking toward a certificate helps keep you motivated\nThe nominal fee helps edX and MITx continue to provide low-cost educational opportunities to the world\nIt is required for the MicroMasters credential.",
