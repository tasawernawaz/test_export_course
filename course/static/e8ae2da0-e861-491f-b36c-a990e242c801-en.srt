00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,130
Inventory is a major issue in every factory.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,770
We show how some inventory is inevitable

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,220
when variability is present in a system of flows.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,170
Inventory is necessary for a factory

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,180
to meet some of its performance goals.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,720
Such as having products available

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,770
when customers want them, or meeting a specified production

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,090
rate target.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,400
However, it has costs.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,170
We will describe some inventory models

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,180
that deal with issues such as, the trade off

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,910
between the risk of having too little inventory to satisfy

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,970
all customers, and having too much so that some items are

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,350
unsold.

15
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,360
We will look at economies of scale.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,340
When is it worthwhile to buy or make more

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,950
than you expect to need immediately because of reduced

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,320
per item costs, even though doing so adds storage costs?
