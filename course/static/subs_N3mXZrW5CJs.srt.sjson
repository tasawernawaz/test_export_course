    "For the third line, we'll notice that the transition", 
    "graph shows that the possible previous states from state 5--", 
    "the states from which the system can reach 5 directly--", 
    "are 2, 3, 6, and 7.", 
    "The probability that the system is in state 5 of time t", 
    "plus delta t, given that it was in state 2 at time t,", 
    "is lambda 5, 2 times delta t.", 
    "The first term in the last line of the equation", 
    "is the part of the probability that the system", 
    "is in state 5 of time t plus delta t, that is due to state 2", 
    "being the possible previous state.",

    "of the transition equation.", 
    "It's equivalent to the second.", 
    "We simply separated out pi 5 from the rest", 
    "of the second line.", 
    "Now we'll subtract pi 5 from both sides of the last equation", 
    "and divide both sides by delta t.", 
    "In addition, we're going to take the limit as delta t goes to 0.", 
    "So this gives us the time derivative of pi 5", 
    "on the left side of the equation.", 
    "This is the transition equation for state 5.", 
    "It would be nice, however, to write", 
    "this equation a little more compactly and symmetrically.", 
    "To do this, recall that we did not define", 
    "lambda i j when i equals j.", 
    "So we have some symbols available for a definition", 
    "of lambda i i.", 
    "To do this, recall that we did not define lambda i j when", 
    "i equals j, so we have some symbols", 
    "available for a definition, lambda i i.", 
    "So why not define lambda 55 as the coefficient of pi 5", 
    "in this equation.", 
    "So that's what we're doing on this slide.", 
    "Notice that I'm saying for convenience.", 
    "I did that because this sometimes confuses people.", 
    "Since lambda 55 is negative, they", 
    "think that we've defined the negative probability,", 
    "or a negative probability rate.", 
    "We have not.", 
    "We have just used an otherwise unused symbol", 
    "to make the equation look a little bit nicer.", 
    "So now the equation looks like this.", 
    "So let's write this in general.", 
    "Pi i of t is the probability that x sub t is equal to i.", 
    "It's convenient, as we said, to define lambda i", 
    "i as minus the sum of lambda j i, where j is not equal to i.", 
    "So now the transition equations become", 
    "d pi i d t equals the sum of lambda i j pi j of t.", 
    "We also have the normalization equation.", 
    "The sum of pi i of t is equal to 1.", 
    "And just to remind you, that lambda i i is often confusing,", 
    "so don't let it throw you.", 
    "So let's look at the same equations in vector matrix", 
    "form.", 
    "So we're going to find pi of t and nu,", 
    "as we did earlier for the discrete time case.", 
    "", 
    "Define the lambda matrix--", 
    "that symbol, if you're not familiar with it,", 
    "is a capital lambda, is the matrix of lambdas.", 
    "The transition equations can be written very compactly as d pi", 
    "d t equals lambda pi of t.", 
    "The normalization equation is new transpose pi equals 1.", 
    "That is, the sum of the pi's equals 1.", 
    "And we have some other facts.", 
    "New transpose p is equal to 0.", 
    "That's important because each column of p sums to 0.", 
    "The reason that the columns sum to 0", 
    "is because of the way we define the diagonal terms.", 
    "The diagonal terms are just the negative", 
    "of the sum of all the other terms in the column.", 
    "", 
    "Also, pi of t is e to the lambda t pi of 0.", 
    "That's a matrix exponential there that e to the lambda t--", 
    "if you're not familiar with it, don't worry about it.", 
    "We will solve any equations that we come up", 
    "with in the usual way, component wise.", 
    "Again, we need to worry about the steady state probability", 
    "distribution.", 
    "So pi i, without an argument, is defined as the limit", 
    "as t goes to infinity of pi i of t, if it exists.", 
    "And that same issue about whether it exists or not occurs", 
    "in the continuous time case.", 
    "The steady state transition equations", 
    "are obtained by just setting d pi d t equals 0.", 
    "So 0 is the sum over j of lambda i j pi j.", 
    "Again, we have an alternative form,", 
    "which is the steady state balance equations, which", 
    "are pi times the sum of lambda i i for all m not equal to i,", 
    "equals the sum over j of j not equal to i of lambda i j pi j.", 
    "And of course, we have the normalization equation.", 
    "That still holds for the steady state equations.", 
    "And we're going to have the same issue in which we", 
    "have to throw out one of the transition equations", 
    "or one of the balance equations and replace it", 
    "with the normalization equation.", 
    "In matrix vector form, we define pi as the limit of pi of t,", 
    "if it exists.", 
    "The steady state transition equations", 
    "can just be written 0 equals lambda pi.", 
    "And the normalization equation is new transpose pi equals 1.", 
    "Here are some sources of confusion", 
    "in dealing with continuous time models,", 
    "if you haven't seen this before.", 
    "Never draw self-loops in continuous time Markov process", 
    "graphs.", 
    "Never write something like 1 minus lambda 14", 
    "minus lambda 24 minus lambda 64.", 
    "Write instead 1 minus, and then in parentheses, lambda 14,", 
    "plus lambda 24, plus lambda 64, times delta t.", 
    "Or just simply, minus the sum of lambda 12,", 
    "lambda 24, lambda 64.", 
    "The reason for that is that the lambdas", 
    "are rates, not pure numbers.", 
    "Whereas, 1 is a pure number.", 
    "So you can have an expression that mixes them both.", 
    "So remember, lambda i i, which is minus the sum of lambda j i,", 
    "where j is not equal to i is not a rate and not a probability.", 
    "It's only a convenient notation.",
