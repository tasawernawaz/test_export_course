    "", 
    "So, the probability of A given B is the probability",

    "And, one way of thinking about that,", 
    "is that the intersection is 1 or 3,", 
    "and the probability of getting A is getting 1 or 3, but not 5.", 
    "So, that's 2/3.", 
    "The law of total probability deals", 
    "with the following question.", 
    "Suppose event A can occur in several different ways.", 
    "Specifically, A might occur if E!", 
    "or E2 or E3, and so forth, occurs.", 
    "We know the probability of E1, E2, and E3 occurring.", 
    "And we know the conditional probability of A occurring,", 
    "given that E1 E2 and so on and so forth, has occurred.", 
    "So, what is the probability of A occurring?", 
    "So, let's look at the slide.", 
    "So we going to build this up simply, from simple cases", 
    "to something more complicated.", 
    "Let B be this set, which is the union of C and D.", 
    "And C and D are disjoint.", 
    "They have no elements in common.", 
    "In that case, the probability of A given C", 
    "is probability of A intersection C, divided by probability of C,", 
    "is just the definition of condition probability.", 
    "And probability of A given D is the probability--", 
    "is the probability of the intersection of A and D,", 
    "divided by probability of D.", 
    "In addition, the probability of C given B", 
    "is equal to the probability of C intersection B, divided", 
    "by the probability of B, which is just probability", 
    "of C over probability of B. Because C intersection B is", 
    "just the same as C. Similarly, the probability of D", 
    "given B is just probability of D divided by probability of B.", 
    "Now, we can write the intersection of A and B,", 
    "as the intersection of A with C union D, which", 
    "is A intersection C, union A intersection D. A intersection", 
    "C and A intersection D are disjoint.", 
    "", 
    "So the probability of A intersection B", 
    "is just the probability of A intersection with C union", 
    "D, which is just the probability of A intersection", 
    "C plus a intersection D, because of that disjointness.", 
    "", 
    "From the definition of conditional probability,", 
    "we can write this equation as P of A given B times", 
    "probability of B, equals P of A given C times the probability", 
    "of C, plus the probability of A given", 
    "D times the probability of D. If we divide through,", 
    "by probability of B, then we get the equation shown.", 
    "And that turns into probability of A given B equals probability", 
    "of A given C, times the probability of C given B,", 
    "plus the probability of A given D,", 
    "times the probability of D given B.", 
    "OK.", 
    "That looks nice.", 
    "Let's see where we can go from there.", 
    "So, a very important case is when", 
    "C union D which is equal to B, is just the whole universe.", 
    "In other words, the dart could land in C", 
    "or it could land in D. No other place.", 
    "And so, we're asking whether the dart has landed in A.", 
    "So A intersection B is equal to A so probability of A", 
    "is equal to probability of A intersection C plus probability", 
    "of A intersection D, which finally leads to this equation.", 
    "Probability of A is equal to probability", 
    "of A given C times the probability of C,", 
    "plus the probability of A given D,", 
    "times the probability of D. OK.", 
    "Let's generalize that and then see what it means.", 
    "The generalization is when we have lots of events.", 
    "So all of these E events, together", 
    "cover the whole set, the whole universe,", 
    "and they have no overlap.", 
    "And the A event is shown by the circle.", 
    "More generally, A and E1 through EK are events.", 
    "And EI intersection EJ equals the empty set for all I", 
    "not equal to J, and the union of all the E's are", 
    "the universal set.", 
    "And we typically say that, as the set", 
    "of the EJ's is mutually exclusive", 
    "and collectively exhaustive.", 
    "Then, the sum of all the probabilities of EJ is equal", 
    "to 1, but more importantly, probability of A is the sum", 
    "of probability of A given EJ times the probability of EJ,", 
    "over all the J's.", 
    "This can be illustrated by a graph, in this figure.", 
    "If I know that EJ has occurred, then there's", 
    "a probability that A has occurred,", 
    "which is given by P of A given E1, and so forth.", 
    "This kind of graph is going to come", 
    "up later when we talked about--", 
    "when we talk about dynamic processes.", 
    "", 
    "Here's an example.", 
    "It's kind of silly, but I think it makes the point.", 
    "Let's set A the event that I will have a cold tomorrow.", 
    "E1 is the set that it says that it's raining today,", 
    "E2 is the event that it's snowing today,", 
    "and E3 is that it's sunny today.", 
    "", 
    "So, we're going to assume that those", 
    "are all the possibilities, and it can only", 
    "either rain or snow or be sunny, and not two of them", 
    "at the same time.", 
    "So, the event A intersection E1 is the event", 
    "that I will have a cold tomorrow and it's raining today.", 
    "", 
    "P of A, given E1, is the probability", 
    "I will have a cold tomorrow given that it's raining today,", 
    "and so forth.", 
    "So, the event that I will have a cold tomorrow", 
    "is the same as either the event that I", 
    "will have a cold tomorrow and it's raining today,", 
    "or I will have a cold tomorrow and it's snowing today,", 
    "or I will have a cold tomorrow and it's sunny today.", 
    "", 
    "So, because of all the assumptions that we made.", 
    "So, the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow", 
    "is equal to the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow", 
    "and it's raining today, plus the probability that I", 
    "will have a cold tomorrow and that snow today,", 
    "plus the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow", 
    "and it's sunny today.", 
    "", 
    "So, the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow", 
    "is the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow, given", 
    "that it's raining today, times the probability that it's", 
    "raining today.", 
    "Plus, the probability I will have cold tomorrow,", 
    "given that it's snowing today, times the probability that it's", 
    "snowing today.", 
    "", 
    "Plus, the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow,", 
    "given that it's sunny today, times the probability that it's", 
    "sunny today, which we can just write this way.",
