00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,580
This week we build on the probability basics

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,030
from last week to discuss random dynamic systems, which

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,189
is what factories are.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,560
In a stochastic process, the state of a system

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,630
evolves randomly over time.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,800
And the present state influences the future.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,250
We focus on Markov processes, a class of stochastic processes

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,820
that is very useful for modeling real world systems.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,430
We study both discrete time and continuous time Markov

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,600
processes.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,640
We develop transition equations, and we

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,770
show how to use them to calculate performance

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,080
measures of complex systems.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,167
We model single unreliable machines

15
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,250
and relate their production rates to their failure

16
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,320
and repaired behavior.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,930
We will use these ideas later to study variations

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,750
of inventory levels over time in production lines that

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,110
consist of many machines.
