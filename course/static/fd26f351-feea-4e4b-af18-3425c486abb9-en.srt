00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,110


1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,630
We're now going to start talking about stochastic processes

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,390
and some specific ones that are important for understanding

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,940
complex systems and, specifically, manufacturing

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,440
systems.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,040
Stochastic processes are random processes in which

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,920
time plays an important role.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,100
We define X as a stochastic process if X of t

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,270
is a random variable for every t.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,590
Here, t is a scalar.

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,330
It really means time for us.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,220
It could be discrete or continuous.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,890
We're going to talk about both cases.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,930
X of t itself can be discrete or continuous,

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,350
a scalar or a vector.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,140
A Markov process is a special stochastic process.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,470
It's one in which the probability of finding X

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,050
at some value at time t plus delta t

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,970
depends only on the value of X at time t.

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,040
In this case, we don't require that delta t be a small number,

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,990
but we will later for some cases.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,500
So another way of saying this, we'll define lower case X of s.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,822
These are values of random variable capital X. So X of s,

23
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,280
where s is less than or equal to t,

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,090
is the history of the values of X before time t.

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,670
And we'll let A be a possible value of X.

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,280
So the statement is that the probability that X

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,580
of t plus delta t equals A--

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,820
given the whole history of X up to and including time t--

29
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,290
is the same as the probability of X( of t plus delta t being

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,450
A, given, only that X of t is equal to little x of t,

31
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,540
only at time t and we don't care about what happens before.

32
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,190
In other words, if we know what X was at time t,

33
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,320
we don't gain any more useful information

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,410
about X of t plus delta t, by also knowing what x

35
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,960
was at any time earlier than t.

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,780
Please keep in mind this is only the definition of a class

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,040
of mathematical models.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,930
It is not a statement about reality.

39
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,585
In other words, not everything is a Markov process.

40
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:11,460
So here's an example.

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,140
Suppose I have $100 at time t equals 0.

42
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,920
At every time t greater than or equal to 1, the amount of money

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,270
I have is called N of t dollars.

44
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,860
Now, each time a possibly biased coin

45
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,800
is flipped, if it lands with H showing, then I gain $1.

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,900
So N of t plus delta t equals N of t plus 1.

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,150
Then N of t plus 1 equals N of t minus 1.

48
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,350
In other words, I lose $1.

49
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,810
So N of t is a Markov process.

50
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,160
Why?

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,290
The reason is that it doesn't matter

52
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,290
what N was at time t minus 1 and t minus 2

53
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,210
all the way back to t 0.

54
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,200
All that determines what N is at time t plus 1

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,580
is what N was at time t and the outcome of the coin flip.

56
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,850
There are four kinds of Markov processes.

57
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,730
Those with discrete state versus continuous state

58
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,760
and those with discrete time versus continuous time.

59
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,190
We're going to start off by talking about discrete state,

60
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,489
discrete time processes.

61
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,280
And later, we'll talk about discrete state,

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,650
continuous time processes.

63
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,470
So in discrete state, discrete time processes,

64
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,380
the states can be numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth.

65
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,240
Or if it's more convenient, we can have multiple indices.

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,950
The time can be numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, or 0, delta 2, delta

67
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,360
and so forth if more convenient.

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,640
So the time is essentially only integers.

69
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,700
The probability of a transition from j to i

70
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,960
in one time it is often written Pij, where

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,270
Pij is the probability that x of t plus 1 equals i,

72
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,270
given that X of t equals j.

73
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,700
And just as a notation note, some people

74
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,590
prefer to put the indices the other way around.

75
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,060
So what I called Pij is called Pji.

76
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,460
This is the transition graph of a discrete time Markov

77
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,530
chain with seven states.

78
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,450
The circles represent the states,

79
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,600
the arrows represent possible transitions.

80
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,460
Of course, we're only indicating transitions

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,980
with non-zero probabilities.

82
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,500
The labels on the arrows are the transition probabilities.

83
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,000
So we can see that if the system is in state 4 at time 12,

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,760
for example, then at time 13, it could be in state 1 or 2 or 6.

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,520
Or it could stay where it is in state 4.

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,510
Given that it's in state 4 at time 12,

87
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,390
then it could be in state 1 at time 13 with probability P14

88
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,670
or state 2 at time 13 with probability P24

89
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,420
or state 6 at time 13 with probability P64.

90
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,750
It might also be at state 4 at time 13

91
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,590
with probability P44, which is 1 minus P14 minus P24 minus P64.

92
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,653
That's the label on the self loop probability.

93
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:06,360


94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,810
There are four possible transitions from state 4,

95
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,210
and the sum of those probabilities must be 1.

96
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,840
So the self loop probability is 1 minus the sum of the others.

97
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,700
The following is an animation that'll

98
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,890
give you some idea of what actually

99
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,750
happens with the system.

100
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,452
We're going to start in state 1 and then

101
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:26,660
we're going to watch it move.

102
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,760
It might go to state 2 at time equals 1

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,380
or it might go to state three, we don't know.

104
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,130
We can think of the way the transitions are determined

105
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,040
by imagining that there's a spinner

106
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,246
at every one of the states.

107
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:41,620
For example, here's the one which

108
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,350
might correspond to state 4.

109
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,590
The red area would correspond to the transition to state 1,

110
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,600
the purple to state 2, the tan to state 6,

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,800
and the yellow staying home at state 4.

112
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,900
So at every time step that you're in state 4,

113
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,690
you spin the spinner and it whizzes around

114
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,790
and it ends up at one of those random places.

115
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,980
And that determines where it goes next.

116
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,050
Here's the system at time 0.

117
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,750
And we're starting it off in state 1.

118
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,920
So at time 1, it's still in state 1.

119
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,690
But at time 2, it's gone to state 3.

120
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,960
At time 4, it's still in state 3, and so on.

121
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,990
So over time, it's going to jump around and go

122
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,200
from state to state.

123
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
It will probably visit every one of these states

124
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,590
if we wait long enough.

125
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,080
And if we wait a long enough time,

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,790
it will go back to the same states.

127
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,250
And what we're interested in in the long run

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,880
is how much time it spends in each one of these states.

129
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,650
Later on, we're going to use this

130
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,960
as a way of representing the failures in repairs

131
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,169
of a machine.

132
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,710
And to begin with, we'll have some very simple pictures where

133
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,000
there are only two states.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,950
One state is up and the other one

135
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,146
is down, operational and under repair.

136
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,270
And we're going to model it as going back and forth

137
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,110
between those two states.

138
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,320
And then later on, we'll have even more complex systems.

139
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,830
The basic idea is a simple system that looks like this.

140
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,214
We'll also be dealing with infinite dimensional systems.

141
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:08,380
That is, where there's an infinite number of states.

142
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,050
And there, there's some other interesting phenomena

143
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,850
that come up that we have to take care of.

144
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,182
Here's another example.

145
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:15,640
We're going to flip coins and count

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,890
how many times we get heads.

147
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,910
So we'll define our state as H of t,

148
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,600
which is the number of heads that we observe

149
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,360
after there are t coin flips.

150
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,520
So let's assume that the probability of heads is p.

151
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,930
So here's the state space.

152
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,810
We start at time 0 and we flip a coin.

153
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,890
If the coin comes up heads, which

154
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,320
it does with probability p, we make the transition

155
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,910
from 0 to 1.

156
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,260
Otherwise with probability 1 minus p, we stay at 0.

157
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,280
When we get to 1, we do the same thing.

158
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,280
And then, we get to 2 and 3 and so on.

159
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,760
So the progression from 1 to 2 to 3

160
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,430
takes place at random times because we don't know what

161
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,740
the coin flip is going to show.

162
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,042
But what we do know is that over time,

163
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:04,000
eventually, we're going to reach all the states

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,140
and go off to infinity.

165
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,730
So we have an infinite space here.

166
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,280


167
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Here's another one.

168
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,220
Remember the coin flip bets that we had at slide 5,

169
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,390
where I gained $1 or lost $1, depending on the coin flip.

170
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,120
Now, we'll allow the coin to be unfair.

171
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,910
So it has probability of heads as p.

172
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,070
And here's the state space.

173
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,775
Now, if we start with $100, for example, if we flip a heads,

174
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,220
we move up to $101.

175
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,130
If we flip tails, we move down to $99.

176
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,730
And we can bounce around along this whole state space.

177
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,919
Again, the state space is infinite,

178
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,840
although we can assume that we never get below 0.

179
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,820
But it's still infinite in the other direction.
