00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,630
Welcome to week. three recitation.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,490
In this video, we'll go over practice problem two

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,859
from the MicroMaster's section.

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,370


6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,030
OK.

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,190
So let me just redraw the transition diagram here.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:26,750
So we have four states, state one, two, three, and four.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,890
Now according to the problem, the transition

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,592
from state one to two is 0.01.

11
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:43,860
The transition from one to three is 0.005.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,250
From three to one, it is 0.05.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,750
From two to three, it is 0.005.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,970
From two to four, it's 0.1.

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,880
From four to one, it is 0.07.

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,940
OK.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,970
So once we have the transition diagram set up,

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,450
the first thing that I do is to set up the transition matrix.

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,450
So if you remember from the continuous time recitation

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,180
video, we said in a discrete state continuous time system,

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,210
each column is going to sum to 0.

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,890
So here are the four states-- one, two, three, four, one,

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,971
two, three, four.

24
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,470
OK.

25
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,030
First, the transition from one to two

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:54,421
is 0.01, one to three 0.005, one to four is 0.

27
00:01:54,421 --> 00:02:02,970
So for this column to sum to 0, this is just 0.015.

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,090
In column two, we have 0.

29
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,050
The transition from two to two is just the sum of the columns.

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,331
From two to three, we have 0.005.

31
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:19,098
Two to four is just 0.1.

32
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:25,302
So right here, we have negative 0.105.

33
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:37,440
In the third column, we have 0.05, 0, negative 0.05, 0,

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:46,930
and lastly 0.07, 0, 0, negative 0.07.

35
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,430
OK.

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,840
Here is our transition matrix.

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,760
Now, we know that one of these equations is redundant,

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,950
and we're going to replace it with the normalization

39
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,370
equation.

40
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:10,680
So the normalization equation is just P1 plus P2 plus P3 plus P4

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,910
equals 1.

42
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,780
So technically this is what we are solving for--

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:27,180
P1, P2, P3, P4 equal to 0.

44
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,230
We're solving for the null space of the transition matrix.

45
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,170
Now, it doesn't matter which equation

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,380
we replace with the normalization equation.

47
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,710
Here, I'm just going to replace the last equation.

48
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:58,820
So our new matrix essentially is 0.015, 0.01, 0.005, 1, 0,

49
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,285
negative 0.105, 0.005, 0.1--

50
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:14,360
no, sorry, this is not 0.1.

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,826
This last part is just 1.

52
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,560
The third column--

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:33,290
0.05, 0, negative 0.05, and 1, 0.07, 0, 0, and 1.

54
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:51,680
And this multiplies by P1, P2, P3, P4 gives us 0, 0, 0, 1.

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,796
This last equation is just a normalization equation.

56
00:04:54,796 --> 00:05:00,230


57
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:12,750
So let's call this matrix A. And let's call this vector B.

58
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,390
And this is the vector P.

59
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,630
So essentially in matrix formation,

60
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:30,070
we have A times P equals B. Now, P is what we are solving for.

61
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,170
So all we have to do is take the inverse,

62
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:44,405
P equals A inverse times B, and this vector P is our solution.

63
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:48,290


64
00:05:48,290 --> 00:06:10,580
P is 0.7458, 0.0710, 0.0817, 0.1015.

65
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,180
The simplest way to solve this matrix multiplication

66
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,130
is to just use Matlab, but you can use a variety of software.

67
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,650
I believe you could use Excel, Mathematica.

68
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,690
Basically any mathematical software

69
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,890
should be able to do this.

70
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,660
This is pretty basic.

71
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:38,580
And you could check that sum of P equals 1.

72
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,270
So the sum of the probabilities adds up to 1,

73
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,530
and we know that's correct.

74
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:50,900
So just so we're clear, it's P1, P2, P3, and P4.

75
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,400
OK.

76
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,660
That will be it for this recitation.

77
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,930

79
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,170
Thank you.
