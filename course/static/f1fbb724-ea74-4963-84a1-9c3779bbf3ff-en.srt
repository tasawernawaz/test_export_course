00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,810


1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,800
Suppose you will make or buy a quantity of some item to sell.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,975
Random demand creates the possibility of the demand being

3
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:12,350
less than that quantity, in which case you are stuck with

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,060
goods you cannot sell.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,280
It also creates the possibility of not having

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,080
enough to meet all the demand.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,200
But if the profit for each sale is high enough,

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,030
you can still make money in the long run

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,527
if you make or buy the right quantity.

10
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,110
The news vendor problem provides a way

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,640
of determining what the right quantity is.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,720
The news vendor is a person who buys newspapers

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,829
at a discount from the newspaper publisher.

14
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,370
He gets them at a discount because he

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,200
buys a large quantity.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
He then sells them on the street to people passing by.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,710
So let's formulate this problem.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,420
The news vendor buys x newspapers

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,980
at c dollars per paper.

20
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,830
That's his cost.

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,780
Then newspapers are sold at a customer

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,441
price of r dollars per paper, which is greater than c.

23
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:58,190
That's his profit.

24
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,020


25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,540
If there are any papers left at the end of a day,

26
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,660
a scrap dealer will buy them at a salvage price s.

27
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,130
s is less than c.

28
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,040
That is, the vendor gets s dollars

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,950
per paper, which is less than c, which

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,350
is how much he had to pay to get the newspapers

31
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,130
in the first place.

32
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,230
So unsold newspapers represent a loss.

33
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,170
This is not quite an inventory problem yet

34
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,020
because we have no inventory dynamics.

35
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,510
Products left at the end of the day cannot be used the next

36
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,650
day, so they're discarded.

37
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,940
So now let's formulate this in a little bit more detail.

38
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,250
Assume the demand is a continuous random variable,

39
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,310
with distribution function capital F of w

40
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,420
is the probability that W is less than little w.

41
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,000
Assume the density function little f of w

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,700
is the derivative of dF dw, and it exists

43
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,420
for all w greater than 0.

44
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,750
The problem that we have is to choose x to maximize

45
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,770
the expected profit.

46
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,460


47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,340
Just keep in mind that w is greater than 0.

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,990
So F of w equals 0.

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,130
And little f of w equals 0 for all w less than 0.

50
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,760
Let's write expressions for the revenue and then the profits.

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,140
If x is less than w, the vendor sells all that he bought.

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,170
So his revenue is rx.

53
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,330


54
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,940
If x is greater than w, that means

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,450
that he has some papers left after he's sold w of them.

56
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,270
So he gets r dollars for the first w,

57
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,310
and only s dollars for the remainder.

58
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,390
So that leads to the expression rw plus s times x minus w.

59
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,880
Now, to get the profit we subtract off cx.

60
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,330
That's what the vendor had to pay to get the newspapers.

61
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,360
So if x is less than or equal to w,

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,630
the profit is r minus c times x.

63
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,800


64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,490
If x is greater than w, it's rw plus s times

65
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,430
x minus w minus cx.

66
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,520
We can rearrange the terms to get

67
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,920
r minus s times w minus c minus s times x.

68
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,980
Notice that c is greater than x, so that last term

69
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,140
represents a loss.

70
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,590
Now here's a graph of profit and revenue

71
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,890
for a case where we pick the numbers that are indicated

72
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,510
at the bottom of the graph.

73
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,540
The horizontal axis is x.

74
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,620
The vertical axis is the profit in dollars.

75
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,030
We chose w equals 500.

76
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,070
So the profit is maximum at x equals 500.

77
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,410
However, you don't know what w is

78
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,780
going to be when you buy the newspapers in the morning,

79
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,700
so you can't pick x equals w.

80
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,580
But anyway, here's what happens if you pick too little or too

81
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,520
much, or if you're lucky enough to get it exactly right.

82
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,830
And notice that if x is too large,

83
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,640
the profit could even be negative.

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,310
This graph is the density function of w.

85
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,280
The vertical axis is the density and the horizontal axis

86
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,380
is W. We've also indicated a value of X.

87
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,080
Now, the region in yellow is the area under the density function

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,910
which is greater than X. And that area represents

89
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,660
the probability that w is greater than X.

90
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,140
The area in pink represents the probability

91
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,710
that W is less than X. Let's superimpose

92
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,560
on that the profit function.

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,200
For a given X, the profit is constant

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,430
when W is greater than X because the profit depends only on X.

95
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,300
However, when W is less than X, the profit

96
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,640
goes down as W is reduced.

97
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,850
And as you can see, the profit could even go negative.

98
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,960
In this graph and in several that will follow,

99
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,190
we will approximate the demand with a normal distribution.

100
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,450
This is reasonable.

101
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,130
If there were n potential customers

102
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,290
and each had a probability p of wanting a paper

103
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,410
independent of all others, the probability distribution

104
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,750
of the demand would be a binomial distribution,

105
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,700
as we saw earlier.

106
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,500
And we also saw that the binomial

107
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,580
is close to the normal.

108
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,750
However, we have to be alert to something.

109
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,180
Demand for newspapers is always positive or 0.

110
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,530
It's never negative.

111
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,140
But the normal distribution can be negative.

112
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,780
The normal is only a good approximation

113
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,990
if the mean of the distribution is much greater

114
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,340
than the standard deviation.

115
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,240
That way, the probability of the normal distribution predicting

116
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,590
a negative demand is very small.
