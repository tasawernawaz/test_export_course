Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,850
Welcome back to 2.854.1x, Intro to Manufacturing Systems.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,390
In this recitation video, we will solve practice problem two

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,940
for week three.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,890
So here's the problem.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,830
This is our transition matrix.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,810
This is a pretty simple discrete-time Markov chain.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,150
So in this problem we solve for the three states.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,310
So the first thing I do is to take this matrix

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,170
and put it into equation form.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:53,425
So here we go, 0.3 pi one plus 0.1 pi two plus 0.6 pi three

12
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:57,070
equals pi one.

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,840
So the second equation is pretty simple.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,630
That's just 0.7 pi two equal pi two.

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:15,680


16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,420
Then we can throw out the third equation

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,460
and replace it with the normalization equation.

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:29,360
So that's simply pi one plus pi two plus pi three equals 1.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,910
Now the second equation, the only way 0.7 pi two

20
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,290
can equal to pi two is if pi two equals 0.

21
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,620
So we could drop this term and drop this term since pi

22
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,540
to is 0.

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:55,220
So now we have 0.3 pi one plus 0.6 pi three equal pi one.

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,340
And just rearrange this equation, we get 0.6 pi three

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,180
equals 0.7 pi one.

26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:15,660
So that means pi three is simply 7 over 6 pi one.

27
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,730
OK, now we substitute into the normalization equation.

28
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:30,510
We have pi one plus 7 over 6 pi one equal 1.

29
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:37,190
So 13 over 6 pi one equals 1.

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:44,870
So this means pi 1 is just 6 over 13.

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,130
And then since we know that pi one plus pi three must equal 1,

32
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:57,310
that means pi three equals 7 over 13.

33
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,540
And that's it.

34
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,860
Hopefully this can help you solve future problems.
