00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009


1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,780
Consider a special case of the system

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,810
that we've been discussing, in which alpha i

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,450
equals 0 for all nodes i.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,000
That means that there's nothing from the outside world that

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,250
enters the system.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,670
p i 0 equals 0 for all nodes, and that means

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,300
that nothing exits the system.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,970
In that case, since nothing is entering

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,340
and nothing is departing from the system,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,170
the number of items in the network is constant.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,300
So the sum of the n i's of t is equal to n, a constant,

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,160
for all t.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,820
The system is closed because nothing gets in or gets out.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,620
This model is useful in analyzing two

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,056
kinds of manufacturing systems.

16
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,430
The first is those in which there

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,230
are a limited number of pallets or fixtures

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,409
to carry parts throughout the system.

19
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:49,950
Parts enter and leave, but the number

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,010
of fixtures in the system stays constant.

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,810
As we'll see, the performance of the system

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,370
depends on the number of fixtures.

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,800
If there are too few, performance suffers.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,270
Think about the food court example,

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,353
and assume there are only a finite number of trays

26
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,050
shared by all the vendors.

27
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,170
If there are only two trays, to be extreme,

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,050
all the vendors would go out of business very soon.

29
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,580
Ideally, there would be enough trays

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,970
so that it would be very rare for a customer not to have one.

31
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,490
Food court trays are cheap, but fixtures in a factory

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,899
can be expensive.

33
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:20,940
There's a trade-off between the financial benefit

34
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,950
of each fixture and its cost.

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,050
The benefit from increasing the number of fixtures

36
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,147
is increased production rate.

37
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:28,980
But there's an upper bound to the production

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,050
rate, which is reached asymptotically

39
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,039
as the number of fixtures is increased.

40
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,830
On the other hand, the cost of the fixtures

41
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,020
is linear in the number of fixtures.

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,350
So there's no upper bound to the cost of fixtures.

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,440
Second, is where there are virtual fixtures.

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,130
A card can be attached to each part that enters this system.

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,620
The part travels with the card, which is then

46
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,570
detached when the part leaves.

47
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,110
The card is then recycled for another part entering.

48
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,330
Such cards are called kanbans.

49
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,040
Kanban is a Japanese word.

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
The kanban approach originated with the Toyota production

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,180
system.

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,960
The number of cards is finite.

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,290
They never leave the system, and no new ones come in.

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,770
The closed queueing network model

55
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,120
may be useful for predicting performance.

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,820
Cards are not expensive, but inventory is.

57
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,410
The number of parts in the system

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,500
is always less than or equal to the number of cards,

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,920
so the number of cards regulates the inventory.

60
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,234
The number of cards is chosen so that the factory meets

61
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:27,150
its production rate requirement with the least

62
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,909
amount of inventory.

63
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:30,450
The mathematics is a little different

64
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,700
here from in the more general case.

65
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,070
That's because lambda equals p lambda does not

66
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,430
have a unique solution.

67
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,430
This means that a different solution approach is

68
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,500
needed to analyze the system.

69
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,410
That solution is used in the example that follows.

70
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,082
A flexible manufacturing system is an automated system

71
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,540
that is capable of operating on a variety of different part

72
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,710
types.

73
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,960
It includes a set of machines, a transportation

74
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,100
system, a control system for dispatching parts to machines.

75
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,650
Different part types require different tools or fixtures

76
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,566
for metal cutting, or different temperatures for ovens,

77
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,940
or different chemicals or paints,

78
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,760
or other features needed for specific products.

79
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,640
Flexibility refers to the variety of different tools,

80
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,190
fixtures, chemicals, et cetera that the system

81
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,260
provides for operations on different part types.

82
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,290
Most importantly, it also refers to the time

83
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,600
it takes to change a machine from being set up

84
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,010
for one operation on a part type to an operation on another.

85
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,650
The less time, the more flexible.

86
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,096
There are many issues in the design of such systems.

87
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:30,970
Many of them are physical, such as the nature

88
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,460
of the machines, the mechanical problems of transportation

89
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,060
in fixed rings, and so forth.

90
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,360
And we will not be dealing with them here.

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,980
The system's design issues include

92
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,320
determining what part type should be manufactured

93
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,870
at the same time in the same FMS,

94
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,210
designing the system for a given set of part types

95
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,160
and the demands for those part types,

96
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,730
and designing the system for possible future part types.

97
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,470
Operation issues include determining

98
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,600
which parts to dispatch to which machines,

99
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,840
and when to dispatch them.

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,500
In the next set of slides, we describe

101
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,720
a model of a flexible manufacturing system.

102
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,750
Like all models, it's an approximation of reality,

103
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,300
and is appropriate for a limited set of uses.

104
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,460
That is, it can be helpful for making some design

105
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,070
decisions, but not all.

106
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,680
This model is intended to help make some early design

107
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
decisions, and in making preliminary evaluations

108
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,600
of some proposed designs.

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,370
Specifically, the purpose of this model

110
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,090
is to estimate the capacity, or the maximum production rate,

111
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,550
of a proposed FMS design.

112
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,890
This capacity is a function of the operation

113
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,185
times of the machines, the number of pallets required,

114
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:36,040
the mix of parts, and the speed of the transportation system.

115
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,990
It can also assist in estimating the amount

116
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,550
of in-process inventory the system

117
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,567
will contain on the average.

118
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,900
However, it does not take into account everything that's

119
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,780
important.

120
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,990
It does not include the changeover times of a machine

121
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,700
from one part type to another.

122
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,717
It assumes that the changeover times are all 0.

123
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,800
While it accounts for the total number of pallets,

124
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,480
it does not account for the possibility

125
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,910
that different parts might require different pallets.

126
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,640
It assumes infinite storage space.

127
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,230
Consequently, this model is useful

128
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,480
for the evaluation of early rough designs,

129
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,380
and for providing preliminary estimates of required machines

130
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,840
and transportation speeds, the number of pallets,

131
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,490
and the work-in-process inventory.

132
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,340
Systems designers can then use those preliminary estimates

133
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,380
to create a more detailed design.

134
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,410
At that point, they must use a more detailed model, preferably

135
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,580
a simulation--

136
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,910
probably a simulation-- to make estimates of the performance

137
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,500
of the system.

138
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,390
In this model, there's a load-unload station,

139
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,620
a transportation system, and n minus 1 machines.

140
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,310
The transportation system is treated as the n-th machine.

141
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,230
There are n pallets.

142
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,240
Part types are not distinguished.

143
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,030
Instead, the set of parts is treated as a single homogeneous

144
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,500
population.

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,570
Instead of modeling the detailed routing

146
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,700
through the system of each part type,

147
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,220
it sends parts to each machine randomly,

148
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,350
in the proportions determined by the processing

149
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,650
requirements of the set of parts that will be produced.

150
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,602
Parts enter the system at the load-unload station.

151
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:01,060
There, they are attached to pallets

152
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,520
and sent to the transportation system.

153
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,800
They wait in a queue for the transportation system

154
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,810
to bring them to one of the machines.

155
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,170
The probability that a part goes to machine i is q i.

156
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,250
The part goes to the load-unload station with probability qM.

157
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,140
So recall the definition of pij.

158
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,900
piM equals 1 means that parts go to the transportation station

159
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,760
after receiving an operation at a workstation.

160
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,400
pMj equals qj is the probability that when

161
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,810
a part leaves the transportation system, it goes to station j.

162
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,440
pij equals 0 means that no part goes directly

163
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,060
from one machine to another.

164
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,370
Parts go from machine to transportation system

165
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,800
to machine.

166
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,290
The service rate at station i is mu i.

167
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,860
That means the average operation time for a part at station i

168
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,930
is 1 over mu i.

169
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,330
The input data is the set of numbers that

170
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,770
describes a particular case.

171
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,720
We've already described M, N, qj, and mu j.

172
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,910
One more thing is sj.

173
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,180
We're analyzing multiple machines at each station,

174
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,550
and those queues are analyzed with the M/M/s model

175
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,500
that we described earlier.

176
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,650
The output data, the production rate, the average time a part

177
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,020
spends in the system, and the utilization

178
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,360
per machine of station j is the information

179
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,820
that we're trying to get out of the model.

180
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,790
These are the performance measures.

181
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,050
In the following graphs, these are the default values

182
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,550
of all the parameters.

183
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,800
We will vary one parameter at a time,

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,330
and see the effect of that variable

185
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,550
on some of the performance measures.

186
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,350
In the first graph, the horizontal axis

187
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,340
is the number of pallets, N. The vertical axis is the production

188
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,250
rate.

189
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,790
P increases monotonically with N,

190
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,490
and reaches an upper limit asymptotically.

191
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,940
We will see similar graphs later for other kinds of systems.

192
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,570
It has this shape because of the infinite buffer assumption.

193
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,330
In reality, if the storage space were limited,

194
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,640
the production rate would increase and then

195
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,710
start to decrease when the number of pallets

196
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,180
gets very large.

197
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,030
This will happen because of blocking and traffic congestion

198
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,330
in the system.

199
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,790
In this graph, the horizontal axis

200
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,620
is still the number of pallets.

201
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,630
The vertical axis is now the average time

202
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,030
a part spends in the system.

203
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,910
The graph is monotonically increasing.

204
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,830
As N increases, the graph looks more and more

205
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,500
like a straight line, and goes to infinity

206
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,320
as the number of pallets goes to infinity.

207
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,940
As the number of pallets increases,

208
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,950
the queues at some or all of the stations

209
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,810
increase without limit.

210
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,270
This causes parts to have to wait longer at some queues.

211
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,179
So the total average time in the system increases.

212
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,470
Again, it has this shape because of the infinite buffer

213
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,700
assumption.

214
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,265
If buffers were finite, there would

215
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:43,390
be an upper bound to the waiting time for the parts

216
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,990
that get into the system, but some parts would not get in,

217
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,860
or would have to wait in a very long queue outside the system.

218
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,420
In this graph, the horizontal axis

219
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,060
is still the number of pallets, N.

220
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,500
The vertical axis is the utilization of the stations.

221
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,430
All graphs are monotonically increasing.

222
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,580
This is because as the number of pallets grows,

223
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,490
the fraction of time that a station has an empty queue

224
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,140
decreases.

225
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,070
As a consequence, the utilization increases.

226
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,770
The ratios of the utilizations are constant.

227
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,840
That is because the processing needs of each part

228
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,840
stays constant no matter how many pallets there are.

229
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,130
All the graphs have asymptotes.

230
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,620
The upper limit for station 2 is 1, or 100% utilization,

231
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,650
and the upper limits for all the others are less.

232
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,540
Why is that?

233
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,850
The reason is that the parts need to go to station 2

234
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,160
more often than the other stations,

235
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,410
or they need to spend more time there.

236
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,620
As N increases, the only limit on the utilizations

237
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,290
of the stations is 100%.

238
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,360
Station 2 reaches that limit because it's

239
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,210
the most highly utilized.

240
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,920
This means that as N increases, there

241
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,110
will be a longer and longer queue at station 2,

242
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,170
and parts will spend increasing amounts of time there.

243
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,270
Since the utilizations of all the other queues

244
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,240
are less than 1, their queues will approach the M/M/s

245
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,000
steady state performance.

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,430
Almost all the time in the graph in the previous slide

247
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,420
is spent waiting in the queue for station 2.

248
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,070
Now, the horizontal axis is the operation time of station 2.

249
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,900
The vertical axis is the utilization

250
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,120
of all the stations.

251
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,700
The utilization of station 2 is increasing,

252
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,790
and the utilizations of all the others are decreasing.

253
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,800
When station 2 is very fast--

254
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,630
that is, when its operation time is very short--

255
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,510
it can satisfy the needs of all the parts

256
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,470
with very little of its time.

257
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,770
Consequently, it goes to 0.

258
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,800
This allows the system to produce at a higher rate,

259
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,870
as we will see in the next slide.

260
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,610
Consequently, the other machines have more work to do,

261
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,270
so their utilizations are high.

262
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,940
As station 2 gets slower, it needs more time

263
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,000
to work on the parts, so it's busy more of the time,

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
and, therefore, its utilization goes up.

265
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,250
This reduces the rate at which it can do its work,

266
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,310
so that the production rate goes down.

267
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,500
This causes the other machines to have less work,

268
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,350
so their utilizations go down.

269
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,150
When station 2 is very slow, it's

270
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,010
the limiting factor on the production rate,

271
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,870
as the next graph shows.

272
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,120
As a consequence, its utilization approaches 100%.

273
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
On this graph, the horizontal axis

274
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,930
is still the operation time of station 2.

275
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,050
The vertical axis is the production rate of the system.

276
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,360
This graph is monotonically decreasing.

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,940
As station 2's operation time increases,

278
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,030
its production rate goes down, and this reduces the production

279
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,190
rate of the system as a whole.

280
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,710
When its operation time is close to 0,

281
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,842
the production rate of the system does not go to infinity.

282
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:40,300
This is because a different station

283
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,320
becomes the limiting factor on the production rate.

284
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,150
Again, on this graph, the horizontal axis

285
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,730
is the operation time of station 2.

286
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,380
The vertical axis is the average time

287
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,330
a part spends in the system.

288
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,760
As station 2 gets slower, we've seen

289
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,920
that its utilization goes up.

290
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,950
This causes the waiting time in its queue to increase.

291
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,440
When the utilization approaches 100%,

292
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,502
the waiting time in its queue goes to infinity,

293
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:07,960
so the average waiting time in the system goes to infinity,

294
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,655
as well.

295
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:10,155
