00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,000
This is Jack here, and this is the second recitation

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
for 2.854.1x.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,720
Due to student requests, this recitation

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,990
will be on Continuous-Time Markov Chains.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,960


7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,470
OK, so here is a simple problem.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,930
So the graph is the transition diagram

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,960
of a machine that sometimes fails and sometimes make

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,400
bad parts.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,340
G is the state when the machine is making good parts.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,600
B is the state when the machine is making bad parts,

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,200
and D is the state when the machine is down.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,600
So when in states G or B, the machine fails at rate p.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,030
So you can see it transitions to D with rate p.

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,380
When in state D, the machine gets repaired and rate r,

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,250
so it recovers from D to G at rate r.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,500
And lastly, when in state G, the machine will

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,070
transition into B at rate q.

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:17,170
So let r equal to 0.05, p equal 0.005, q to be equal to 0.1,

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,310
and mu is just 1, so one part per operation time.

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,070


23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,450
OK.

24
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,420
So the first thing we need to solve for

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,520
is the steady state probabilities.

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,370
From there, we'll be able to get everything else.

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,960
So let me redraw the transition diagram again.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,830


29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:48,292
Here's state G, B, D. OK.

30
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:56,060
So the transition from G to B is q, and we said q equals 0.1.

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:04,740
From B to D is p, which is 0.0005.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:15,365
From G to D is also 0.005, and from D to G

33
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:20,600
is r, which is 0.05.

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,470
So similar to the discrete time Markov chains,

35
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,970
what I normally do is to set up the transition matrix.

36
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,210
So here it is.

37
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:41,580
States G, B, and D to G, B, and D. OK.

38
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,890
So the first transition, we have the transition from D to G,

39
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,830
and that is just r.

40
00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:02,610
So from D to G, we're looking at r which is 0.05, OK?

41
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,300
The next one, from G to B, which is 0.1.

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,178
So from G to B this is 0.1.

43
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:13,230
OK.

44
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:32,330
From G to D, we have 0.005, and from B to D, we have 0.005.

45
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:39,810
OK, so from the lecture, we know that the diagonal is simply

46
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,580
the negative of the sum of the remaining

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,410
entries in each column.

48
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,740
So basically every column will have to sum to 0.

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:57,180
So this means this is just negative 0.105.

50
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:06,190
This is negative 0.005, and this is negative 0.05.

51
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,000
And the last two cells are just 0.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
OK.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,750
So from here we could do one of two things.

54
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,750
We could solve for the null space of this matrix,

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,920
meaning we find the vector that makes

56
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,730
the solution of the product 0.

57
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:35,690
So basically, we find a vector here, x1, x2, x3, such

58
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:42,390
that the product equals the 0 vector, OK?

59
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,620
And once we get x1, x2, and x3, we

60
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,420
can normalize it so all three sums to 1.

61
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,570
That gives us our steady state probabilities.

62
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,240
But in this recitation, we're going

63
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,380
to solve it through setting up each equation,

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,120
and replacing one of the equations

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,230
with the normalization equation step by step.

66
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:08,782


67
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:09,520
OK.

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,350
So let's set up these equations.

69
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,710
So the first equation, we have--

70
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,040
let's see.

71
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,980
So negative-- so OK.

72
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:32,340
Here we have P1, PG, PB, and PD.

73
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,340
These are the steady state probabilities, OK?

74
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,380
And they equal to 0, just like I had it before.

75
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:54,450
So first equation, negative 0.105 times PG plus 0.05

76
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,765
times PD equals 0.

77
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:02,840


78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:18,430
The second equation, 0.1 PG minus 0.005 PB equals 0.

79
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,890
OK, so if you work this out, you'll

80
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:33,470
see that PD is just 2.1 PG, OK?

81
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:41,110
And PB is just 20 PG.

82
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,610
OK.

83
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,890
So everything is in PG's now.

84
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,860
So here is our normalization equation.

85
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:56,580
PG plus PB plus PD will equal to 1, so let's substitute.

86
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:10,962
So we have PG plus 2.1 PG plus 20 PG that equals 1.

87
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,570
OK.

88
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:29,230
So PG 1 over 23.1, which equals 0.0433, OK?

89
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,280
So PB is just 20 times that.

90
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:52,530
So PB equals 20 over 23.1, which is 0.8658.

91
00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:12,410
And now we have PD, which is 2.1 over 23.1, which equals 0.0909.

92
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,120
So here it is.

93
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,344
This is PD, PG, and PB.

94
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:20,260
And the sum of those three should add up to 1.

95
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,880


96
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,090
OK, so now we have the steady state probabilities.

97
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,350
Now let's solve for the production rate.

98
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,750
So just a reminder, we said mu equals 1, right?

99
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,409
So it makes one part per operation time.

100
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,620
So the production rate is simply the amount

101
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,740
of good parts and bad parts this machine

102
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,410
can produce per operation time.

103
00:08:47,410 --> 00:09:00,432
So production rate is just PG plus PB, which equals 0.9091.

104
00:09:00,432 --> 00:09:05,710
So it makes 0.9091 part per operation time.

105
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,460


106
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,480
So lastly, let's solve for the yield.

107
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,780
The yield is defined as the percentage

108
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,680
of good parts produced out of all the parts,

109
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:27,740
and so in our case it's simply just PG divided by PG plus PB.

110
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,580


111
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:42,824
And that is equal to 0.0433 divided by 0.9091.

112
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:46,320
So our yield is 4.76%.

113
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,600
