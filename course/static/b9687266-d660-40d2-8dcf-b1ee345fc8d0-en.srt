1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,680
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,019
This is Jack here.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,560
In this recitation video, we're going

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,260
to go over how to solve parts one and two of the week four

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,190
graded problem two.

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,360


7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,760
So here's the problem--

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,050
Youngjie's machine job.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,540
Basically, there is a buffer station in one machine.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,400
The buffer station could hold up to two parts.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,910
The machine could hold for hold one part.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,220
So the total number of parts that's possible in the system

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,630
is three.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,530
Now, there was quite a bit of confusion over this problem

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,740
because lambda in parts one and two

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,040
is either greater than or equal to mu.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,500
So that means if this is typical MM1 system,

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,340
there won't be a steady state.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,500
However because the queue is not infinite,

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,060
you cannot just use the MM1 formula.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,989
So I think this is where a lot of the confusion came from.

22
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,360
So when you arrive at a problem that

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,880
doesn't fit a prescribed set of formula,

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,340
it's best to derive it from the transition inclusions.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,890
So in this recitation video, I will show you

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,460
how to set up the transition diagram, the Markov

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,690
matrix, and then steady-state probability equations.

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,430


29
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,110
OK, so in part one of the problem, basically

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,630
the issue is lambda is equal to mu.

31
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,110


32
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,400
So the system has four states.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,370
It could either have zero parts in the system,

34
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,850
one part in the system, two parts in the system,

35
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,500
and three parts in the system--

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,170
so a total of four states.

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,850
And parts are arriving at a rate mu.

38
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,290
So that means-- parts are arriving at lambda, sorry.

39
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:18,160
So the transition diagram looks something like this, right?

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,190
And then when they get milled, it

41
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,410
returns to a previous state at a rate mu.

42
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:31,090


43
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,580
So here is the transition diagram.

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,120
It's a pretty simple one for this problem.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,290
Now, how do we set up the transition matrix or the Markov

46
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,940
matrix?

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, this is a continuous-time Markov chain.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,550
And in the recitation video in week three,

49
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,360
I demonstrated how to set up that matrix.

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,230
I'll do it again here.

51
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,700
So here's a matrix.

52
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,360
And like I did before, I like to put the states here.

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,650
1, 2, and 3, 0, 1, 2, and 3.

54
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,260
So let's fill in the transitions.

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,890
So to go from state 0 to 1, we are at rate lambda.

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,830
0 to 1.

57
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,730
1 to 2 lambda.

58
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,890
2 to 3 lambda.

59
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:40,380
OK, so 3 to 2 mu.

60
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,330
2 to 1 mu.

61
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,510
And 1 to 0 is mu.

62
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,070
So you have a lower diagonal and an upper diagonal.

63
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,710
And we know that each row has to sum to 0,

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,890
so let's just fill them out.

65
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,110
So you have negative lambda.

66
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:08,700
Over here, you have negative lambda plus mu, negative lambda

67
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,110
plus mu, and negative mu.

68
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,680


69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,130
And like we did before, so here are

70
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,079
the steady-state probabilities.

71
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,902
P0, P1, P2, P3.

72
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,455
And that equals to 0.

73
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:32,830
So really, all you have to do is solve for the null space

74
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,260
of this matrix.

75
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,780
It's simple to do because you know that lambda equals mu.

76
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,150
So you could either replace lambda with mu or mu

77
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,530
with lambda.

78
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,310
But I will set up the steady-state equations.

79
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,040


80
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:57,100
So the first equation is negative lambda P0 plus mu

81
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,770
P1 equal to 0.

82
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:15,480
And we have lambda P0 minus lambda plus mu P1 plus mu

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,965
P2 equal to 0.

84
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:20,810


85
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:34,030
Lambda P1 minus lambda plus mu P2 plus mu P3 equals 0.

86
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:45,740
And lambda P2 minus mu P3 equals 0.

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,970
Here are our four equations.

88
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,570
And then, we also have our normalization equation.

89
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:57,410
So P0 plus P1 plus P2 plus P3 equals 1.

90
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,360
OK, 5 equations and 4 [INAUDIBLE]..

91
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,160
So we just throw out one of the equations.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,330
I always throw out the one with three terms,

93
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,360
so let's just throw out this one.

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,810
Now, this equation is actually a lot easier

95
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,540
to solve because lambda equals to mu.

96
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:20,900
So negative-- I'm sorry, so mu P1 equals lambda P0.

97
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,990
Since lambda equals to mu, they just cancel.

98
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,050
So P1 equals P0.

99
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,790


100
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,570
Let's go to the next one, OK?

101
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:38,160
So lambda P2 equal to mu P3.

102
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,180
And once again they cancel, so P2 equals P3.

103
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,740


104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,080
So this equation becomes lambda P1

105
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:59,605
minus 2 lambda P2 plus lambda P2, which equals to 0.

106
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:03,730


107
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,240
So this term-- this 2 cancels.

108
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,950
So what do we have?

109
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,750
P1 equals P2.

110
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:20,185
OK, so if P1 equals P2, and P1 also equals P0,

111
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:27,780
but P2 equals P3, that means P1 equals P2 equals P3 equals P0.

112
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:40,720
So this means that P0 plus P0 plus P0 plus P0 equals the 1.

113
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,810
So P0 equals 1/4, which equals P1 equals P2 equals P3.

114
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,510


115
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,080
So this is how you solve for the steady-state probability.

116
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,160
OK, so the question asked us to solve for L. L is the expected

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,500
number of parts in the system.

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,030


119
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,710
This is just basically, the expectation

120
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,790
of a discrete probability.

121
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:23,100
So you have 0 times 1/4 plus 1 times 1/4 plus 2 times

122
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,185
1/4 plus 3 times 1/4.

123
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:31,110


124
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,669
And this is just equal to 1.5.

125
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,400
And that's the solution to part one.

126
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:47,420


127
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,480
So part two really is the same thing.

128
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,490
Instead of lambda equal to mu, we have lambda equals 2 mu.

129
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,302


130
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,760
So really, you just have to solve the same set of equations

131
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,051
with this substitution instead.

132
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:02,630


133
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,510
So I'm going to fast forward a little

134
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,440
bit and just get to the substitution.

135
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:20,020
So basically, we have P1 equals 2 P0.

136
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:28,730
So that means 1/2 P1 equals P0.

137
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,500
And P2 equals 1/2 P3.

138
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,290


139
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,630
Now, let's make the substitution here.

140
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,100


141
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:59,480
So 2 mu P1 minus 3 mu P2 plus mu P3 equals 0.

142
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,720


143
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,836
So let's substitute 1/2 P3.

144
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:11,506
Let's substitute this.

145
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:28,430
So 2 mu P1 minus 3 mu over 2 P3 plus 2 mu over 2 P3 equals 0.

146
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,890
OK?

147
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,330
So this term cancels.

148
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,120


149
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,250
So 2 mu P1 equals mu over 2 P3.

150
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,530


151
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,090
So let's cancel the mu.

152
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,980
So P1 equals 1/4 P3.

153
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,760


154
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,910
So I'm going to put everything in terms of P0.

155
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:10,970
So 2 P0 equals 1/4 P3 because of this right here.

156
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:19,240
So P0 equals 1/8 P3.

157
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,880
It's also 1/8 P1.

158
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,580


159
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:38,750
Now, P2 is equal to 1/2 8 P3.

160
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,920
So this is just 4 P3.

161
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,230


162
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,870
Sorry, this is a P0, my bad.

163
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,910
OK, 4 P0.

164
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,350
OK, so everything is in P0.

165
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,945
So P0 plus P1.

166
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:02,720
And P1 is just 2 P0.

167
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,061
P2-- P2 is 4 P0.

168
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:14,850
Plus P3, 8 P0 equals 1.

169
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,370
This comes from here, just flip the 8.

170
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,295
So 8 P0 equals P3.

171
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:22,930
It comes from this equation.

172
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:31,440
So P0 just equal to 1/15.

173
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:48,680
And now, we substitute P1 equals 2/15, P2 4/15, and P3 is 8/15.

174
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,080


175
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,430
The last part, once again, asks us to solve for L. So

176
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:10,640
it's just 0 times 1/15 plus 2 times 2/15 plus--

177
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,490
sorry, this is 1.

178
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,715
2 times 4/15 plus 3 times 8/15.

179
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:25,080
That is 2.26.

180
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,910
