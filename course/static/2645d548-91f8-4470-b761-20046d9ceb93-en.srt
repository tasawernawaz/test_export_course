00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510


1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,040
We've been discussing model mixing,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,810
but mixing models only makes sense

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,440
if setup changes are quick and not costly.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,990
All people, and many machines, can perform more than one task.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,940
In many cases, an activity is required

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,940
to change the tasks that a machine is performing.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,190
An activity may also be required for the machine

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,030
to perform the same task but on a different part.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,580
This activity is called a setup change.

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,250
An example of a setup change is a CNC machine

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,890
that can make many different holes in a work piece.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,170
It has a tool magazine or holder for the tools

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,300
needed for a given piece.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,210
In order to work on a different work piece, the tools as well

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,640
as the programming have to be changed.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,280
But changing tools can take time.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,310
Setup changes can be time consuming and sometimes

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,930
expensive for other reasons.

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,640
They reduce the time that a machine can

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,860
be used for productive work.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,260
If they are done infrequently to reduce

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,570
the loss of productive time, they

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,030
cause inventory to be stored.

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,040
Machines that have very short setup times

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,050
are said to be flexible.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,770
Toyota has had a major emphasis on reduction of setup time.

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,650
For example, let's consider the pressing department.

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,560
Pressing is the process of deforming sheet metal

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,300
into body panels.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,540
The setups involve changing the dies, the heavy metal

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,240
objects that give the panels their shape.

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,330
When dies are changed, it takes time to remove the old ones

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,450
and put the new ones into precise positions.

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,470
Between 1945 to 1954, it took two to three hours

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,570
to change these dyes.

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,720
Between '55 and '64 it took 15 minutes.

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,640
But after 1970, it only took three minutes.

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,000
An internal setup is one that can only

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,640
be done while a machine is stopped.

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,460
In the tool changing example, if the tool magazine

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,220
is built into the machine, tools can only

42
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,510
be changed while the machine is stopped,

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,930
so setups are internal.

44
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,240
External setup work is work that can

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,630
be done while an operation is taking place.

46
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,790
In that example, if the machine is redesigned

47
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,220
so the tool magazine is removable

48
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,890
and there's a spare magazine, the tool change

49
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,900
can be mostly external.

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,850
While the machine is making one part type

51
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,400
using one of the magazines, the other magazine

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,250
is populated with the tools for the next part type.

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,880
Often a setup change involves both kinds of activities.

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,280
One element of the setup time reduction strategy

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,950
is to convert some of the internal change activity

56
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,630
to external.

57
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,210
Setup changes are impediments to model mixing.

58
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,430
Models can only be mixed if the setup change

59
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,380
times are very short.

60
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,860
Reducing setup times is the job of machine designers.

61
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,750
Manufacturing systems engineers can

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,440
determine where such reductions are needed most.

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,420
But let's talk about standardizing operations.

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,280
The goal of standardizing operations

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,020
is to minimize the number of workers in production.

66
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,380
To do that, you have to maximize the efficiency of the work

67
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,020
and eliminate wasteful motions.

68
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,200
The standardized order of actions performed for each task

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,180
are posted as standard operations

70
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,410
routine sheets to be visible to all workers.

71
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,630
The next goal is to minimize WIP.

72
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,830
The next goal is to minimize WIP.

73
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,370
There's a standard quantity of work in process.

74
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,650
Operations consists of several activities,

75
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,840
such as making several holes that cannot be done

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,430
simultaneously.

77
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,200
A line consists of workstations that

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,180
perform each of the operations.

79
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,330
Line balancing is the process of allocating these operations

80
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,640
to workstations.

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,190
The cycle time of an operation is

82
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,200
the time it takes to complete the operation.

83
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,320
The cycle time of a line is the maximum cycle time

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,800
of any operation on the line.

85
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,840
Ideally, operations on the same line

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,540
should take the same length of time.

87
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,180
Standard operations are determined by the foreman, not

88
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,970
the industrial engineering staff.

89
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,010
The takt time is defined as the time

90
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,370
in which one copy of an item must be produced.

91
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,090
It's given by the ratio of the effective daily operating time.

92
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,910
It is given by the effective daily operating time divided

93
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,440
by the required daily quantity.

94
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,430


95
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,220
A necessary condition for the line to meet the demand

96
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,390
is that the cycle time be less than or equal to the takt time.

97
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,340
It means that the line could make the required

98
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,800
quantity or more every day.

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,770
This is also called feasibility.

100
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,750
Late in the month, the central planning office

101
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,450
tells each production department the volume

102
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,910
required for the next month, in effect

103
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,310
the next month's takt time.

104
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,530
Lines are rebalanced so that the cycle time

105
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,930
is less than the takt time.

106
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,790
If the takt time is shorter than before,

107
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,850
some workstations may have to be added.

108
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,820
Process managers determine how many workers are needed.

109
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,340
Let's say a little bit about process design.

110
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,740
The earlier layouts of the Toyota factories

111
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,300
had machines organized by type and one worker per machine.

112
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,540
We described this in the first week as a job shop.

113
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,090
In the Toyota production system layout,

114
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,610
machines are organized to smooth material flow.

115
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,730
Each worker handles three different machines.

116
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,740
And a worker deals with one piece at a time.

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,300
This is called one piece flow.

118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,140
The benefits are that inventory is reduced,

119
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,560
fewer workers are needed, and workers feel better

120
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,400
about their jobs, at least according to [? Mundin. ?]

121
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,920
Workers also have an increased knowledge of the production

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,258
process.

123
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:40,758
