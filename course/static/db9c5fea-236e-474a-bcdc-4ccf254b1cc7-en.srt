1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,110
Everybody knows that storage and inventory

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,100
are important in businesses.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,890
But in fact, let's step back a second

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,720
and observe that storage is really

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,490
fundamental in nature as well as management

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,410
and also engineering.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,030
In nature, energy is stored.

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,550
Life can only exist if the acquisition of energy

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,300
can occur at a different time from the expenditure of energy.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,550
In fact, I'm guessing that at least some of the people

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,830
watching this video are not eating.

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,140
Those people are using their stored energy.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,930
In management, products are stored.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,700
In engineering, energy is stored in springs, in batteries,

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,640
in capacitors, in inductors, and so forth.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,490
Information is stored in RAM and hard disks.

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,030
Water is stored in dams and reservoirs.

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,620
Storage has cost as well as benefits.

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,730
We will discuss both in the set of slides.

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,380
The purpose of storage is to allow

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,290
systems to survive even when important events are

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,790
unsynchronized--

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,310
for example, the separation in time

24
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,440
from the acquisition or production of something

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,380
and its consumption, the occurrence of an event at one

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,540
location such as a machine failure or a power

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,300
surge which can prevent desired performance

28
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,460
or do damage at another.

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,200
Storage improves system performance

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,530
by decoupling parts of the system from one another.

31
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,080
Unsynchronization is what makes storage necessary.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,940
Randomness causes unsynchronization,

33
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,890
but we will see that deterministic systems can

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,380
have unsynchronized components as well.

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,360
And such systems can require storage.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,760
Storage allows production systems of energy of goods

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,670
to be built with capacity less than the peak demand.

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,280
In particular, it helps manage seasonality.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,590
Factories or businesses who get their greatest revenue

40
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,570
from Christmas sales start production

41
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,790
during the summer or earlier.

42
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,980
Consequently, they have to store lots of inventory,

43
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,410
and they have to store it for a long time.

44
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,165
Their peak demand occurs in the last month before Christmas,

45
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:55,540
and that demand rate is much greater than the demand rate

46
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,220
during the rest of the year.

47
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,260
They would probably prefer to start production

48
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,060
in November if they could.

49
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,137
That would reduce their inventory costs,

50
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:05,470
and it would allow them to have much more accurate sales

51
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,370
forecasts.

52
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,662
So why don't they?

53
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,620
They don't, because if they started Christmas production

54
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,320
in November, they would need much greater production

55
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,430
capacity, much bigger factories, or many more factories.

56
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,930
They would have to produce at a much greater production rate

57
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,420
during last month, and most of those facilities

58
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,310
would be idle for most of the year.

59
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,850
That idle production capacity would be very expensive.

60
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,010
Similarly, the cost of power plants

61
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,460
depends mainly on their peak energy generation rate.

62
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,200
Energy demand varies during the day

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,000
and is not at its peak all day and night.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,030
If plants could be built to produce constantly

65
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,190
at the daily average of demand rate,

66
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,030
they would be much less expensive.

67
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,360
But this is only possible if there were energy storage

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,860
facilities available.

69
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,050
Storage of energy will become much more important

70
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,730
as renewable energy replaces fossil fuels.

71
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,970
The sun and the wind generate useful energy only

72
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,410
intermittently.

73
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,300
For renewables to be effective, they

74
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,910
would have to generate energy at a greater rate than demand

75
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,210
while they're producing, and that temporary excess of what

76
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,970
they're producing over demand would be saved for periods

77
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,650
when they're not producing.

78
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,720
It reduces the propagation of disturbances,

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,210
and thus reduces the instability and the fragility

80
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,450
of complex, expensive systems.

81
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,150
As we've already discussed, if a machine is stopped

82
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,520
for a long time, it will cause neighboring machines

83
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,210
to be idle if there's little inventory or inventory space.

84
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,200
We will see this in greater detail later in the course.

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,900
Let's be a little specific about the benefits

86
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,970
and costs of inventory in factories-- first,

87
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,620
the benefits.

88
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,140
Storage allows economies of scale--

89
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,360
in particular, in volume purchasing.

90
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,850
Per item prices are always less for large orders

91
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,560
than for small batches, but if you

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,270
buy something in a large batch, you

93
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,070
need to store it before you can use all of it.

94
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,760
Reduced set-ups-- set-ups diminish the time

95
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,440
in which machines can produce.

96
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,190
This motivates infrequent set-ups.

97
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,950
However, to have infrequent set-ups,

98
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,240
you must have large batches, and that means you have storage.

99
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,000
It helps manage uncertainty, including

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,370
the random arrival of customers or orders

101
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,250
and unreliable deliveries of raw materials.

102
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,770
Suppose you knew the average daily demand for an item.

103
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,340
No day's demand will be exactly that average.

104
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,540
A reasonable production strategy would

105
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,100
be to make sure that each day you

106
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,040
have on hand the average demand plus a small quantity called

107
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,600
"safety stock."

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,670
If anything is unsold at the end of the day,

109
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,710
you can use it to meet the demand the next day.

110
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,220
Now the costs-- the first cost is financial.

111
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,250
Raw materials are paid for, but no revenue comes in

112
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,750
until the item is sold.

113
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,880
If you borrow money to pay for raw material,

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,160
you incur interest which you can't pay back until you

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,630
sell the goods you make.

116
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,580
The more inventory you hold, the longer it

117
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,380
takes to get it through the factory,

118
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,350
and the more you have to pay in interest.

119
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,840
Demand risk-- an item loses value or is unsold

120
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,410
due to obsolescence-- for example, newspapers,

121
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,690
technology, fashion goods.

122
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,280
In addition, there's holding cost and shrinkage.

123
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,199
"Shrinkage" means damage, or theft, or spoilage, or loss.

124
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,490
Here we're going to show how unsynchronized variability

125
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,080
causes inventory.

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,690
This is a picture of a tank that holds water.

127
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,050
Water comes in at a rate of 75 gallons a second,

128
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,390
and water can leave at a rate of 75 gallons a second.

129
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,820
If we start with an empty tank, the tank

130
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,590
is always empty except for a little bit

131
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,570
of splashing around the bottom.

132
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,880
But now let's add a little randomness.

133
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,410
We'll put a valve in the pipe carrying water in and one

134
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,140
in the pipe carrying water out.

135
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,540
The valves are open sometimes and closed other times,

136
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,550
but on the average, they carry the same volume

137
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,194
of water per time as in the previous slide.

138
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:45,110
When they're open, water can pass through them

139
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,260
at a rate of 100 gallons per second.

140
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,410
Of course, when they're closed, no water passes through them.

141
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,140
The average period when the valve is open is 15 minutes.

142
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,830
The average period when it's close to five minutes.

143
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,050
Consequently, the average flow rate through it

144
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,250
is 75 gallons per second.

145
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,130
Let's look at some of the possibilities that

146
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,080
can happen in this case.

147
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,660
First of all, both valves can be closed.

148
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,480
If they're both closed, no water comes in or goes out.

149
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,340
The amount of water that's in the tank

150
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,920
is staying constant during this period.

151
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,690
How it got to the level it got depends

152
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,370
on the past history of the valves being opened and closed.

153
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,570
The second case is where the first valve is open

154
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,370
and the second one is closed.

155
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,230
In that case, water enters the tank but can't get out,

156
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,340
so the water level in the tank rises.

157
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,470
On the contrary, we can have the first valve closed

158
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,590
and the second valve open in which case nothing comes in,

159
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,356
but water comes out as long as there's water in the tank.

160
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:43,480
When there's no more water in the tank, it's empty.

161
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,490


162
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,750
And finally, both valves can be open at the same time, in which

163
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,960
case 100 gallons per second goes in and 100 gallons per second

164
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,400
goes out.

165
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,310
The water level stays constant during that period.

166
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,829
So what can we observe from this illustration?

167
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,370
There was never any water in the tank

168
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,335
when the flow is constant in the first case.

169
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,210
Of course, there's a little bit of splashing,

170
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,220
but let's not worry about that.

171
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,320
There's sometimes water in the tank when the flow is variable.

172
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,800
Conclusions-- a very general conclusion first.

173
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,890
You can't always replace random variables with their averages

174
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,860
for the purpose of predicting the behavior of a system.

175
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,510
Sometimes you can.

176
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,310
It depends on the nature of the system,

177
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,300
the nature of the variability, and the quantity

178
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,080
you're trying to predict.

179
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,300
But the main point for us is that variability

180
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,180
causes inventory.

181
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,790
To be more precise, non-synchronization

182
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,470
causes inventory.

183
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,360
To be more precise, non-synchronization

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,190
causes inventory.

185
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,780
Living things do not acquire energy

186
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,610
at the same time they expend it, therefore,

187
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,880
they must store energy in the form of fat or sugar.

188
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,470
Rivers are dammed and reservoirs are

189
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,930
created to control the flow of water

190
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,390
to reduce the variability of the water supply.

191
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,310
For solar and wind power to be successful,

192
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,580
energy storage is required for when the sun doesn't shine

193
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,600
and the wind doesn't blow.

194
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,090
To wrap up this video, let's list some of the topics

195
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,380
we're going to talk about--

196
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,080
first of all, the news vendor problem where we have demand

197
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,500
risk although no inventory dynamics.

198
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,790
There's the economic order quantity problem--

199
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,860
deals purely with economies of scale,

200
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,840
and the demand is deterministic.

201
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,679
The QR policy adds to the economic order quantity

202
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,059
problem, the supplier lead time, and random demand.

203
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,770
We'll describe a base stock policy

204
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,720
for managing a simple factory in order to avoid stockouts,

205
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,209
and there will be a few other topics.
