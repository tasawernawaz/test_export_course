    "This set of videos is a brief overview and summary", 
    "of some of the key elements of the Toyota Production System.", 
    "The references for this set of videos", 
    "are Toyota Production System, a book by Yasuhiro Monden,", 
    "and Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Production System", 
    "by Steven Spear and Kent Bowen, Harvard Business Review,", 
    "September, October 1999.", 
    "There are very many books, articles,", 
    "and websites that describe the Toyota Production System.", 
    "The Toyota Production System was developed by Toyota", 
    "after World War II.", 
    "In the postwar period, the west--", 
    "especially the United States-- was relatively prosperous.", 
    "It was important to US manufacturers", 
    "to satisfy high postwar demand.", 
    "The price of goods was not as important as the production", 
    "of large quantities at high production rates.", 
    "Japan was poor.", 
    "Cost minimization and efficiency were most important", 
    "to Japanese manufacturers.", 
    "Toyota Production System is low-tech, not dependent", 
    "on computers when they came available in the 1960s.", 
    "All required actions had to be easily understood and executed.", 
    "The Toyota Production System has been highly influential", 
    "and widely imitated.", 
    "Many Japanese words have entered the manufacturing vocabulary", 
    "due to the Toyota Production System.", 
    "Knowing my limitations, I will make no claim", 
    "to pronouncing any of them correctly.", 
    "The Toyota Production System is concerned", 
    "with all aspects of manufacturing business,", 
    "not just factory design and operation.", 
    "It deals with the people in the company-- both the ergonomics", 
    "and psychology.", 
    "It discusses how to implement its methods,", 
    "considers material handling, information handling,", 
    "improvement activities, its relationships with car dealers", 
    "and parts suppliers.", 
    "People spend years studying it.", 
    "Many people make a nice living as consultants helping", 
    "companies to implement it.", 
    "We will only deal with a very small part of this.", 
    "The goal of these videos is to make", 
    "you aware of some of the most important aspects of it", 
    "and to focus on manufacturing systems' engineering issues,", 
    "but there's a lot more to it.", 
    "First, we'll discuss the goals of the Toyota Production", 
    "System.", 
    "The goal of a business is to make profits.", 
    "This would appear to be obvious, but people in factories", 
    "often lose sight of this.", 
    "One reason is that people focus on their local subset", 
    "of the factory.", 
    "People are given quantitative performance", 
    "goals which are intended to help them contribute to factory", 
    "performance, but such goals could actually", 
    "reduce performance if not chosen wisely and updated as needed.", 
    "Toyota's primary goal is cost reduction and the improvement", 
    "of productivity.", 
    "By cost, they mean cash outlay for the purpose", 
    "of making a profit.", 
    "Cost includes manufacturing costs,", 
    "sales cost, administrative cost, and capital cost.", 
    "So the first element is profit through cost reduction.", 
    "The second is elimination of waste.", 
    "Waste includes excessive production resources.", 
    "Excessive production resources includes excessive workforce", 
    "which increases cost through salaries.", 
    "It includes excessive facilities which", 
    "creates cost by depreciation and financing and many others.", 
    "The problem is to figure out what is excessive.", 
    "Another source of waste is overproduction.", 
    "That's continuing production when products are not", 
    "currently needed.", 
    "Toyota sees this as the worst kind of waste.", 
    "Excessive inventory, of course, comes from overproduction.", 
    "We've discussed this in previous videos.", 
    "Inventory, in addition to its other costs,", 
    "requires manpower to manage it, people to transport it,", 
    "clerks to keep track of it, and so forth.", 
    "Unnecessary capital investment is another source of waste.", 
    "It's not just the production equipment, but also", 
    "forklifts to move around unnecessary inventory,", 
    "areas to store unnecessary inventory, and so on.", 
    "Additional elements of the Toyota Production System", 
    "include quality control, which is to adapt production", 
    "to daily and monthly fluctuations", 
    "in quantity and variety, quality insurance, which is the effort", 
    "to ensure that each process supplies only good products", 
    "to the next process.", 
    "This is not just rejecting bad products by inspection", 
    "or reworking them.", 
    "It's improving production quality in the first place.", 
    "And respect for people--", 
    "recognition that people are what make the factory work", 
    "effectively and that if there's poor morale,", 
    "profits are reduced.", 
    "This is not just a slogan.", 
    "There's lots of detailed discussion", 
    "of this in the Toyota Production System.", 
    "People have to actively participate", 
    "in all concepts and goals of the Toyota Production System.",

    "at the necessary times.", 
    "This leads to minimal inventories.", 
    "Autonomation, or jidoka-- this is autonomous defects control.", 
    "This is never allowing defective items to enter and disrupt",

    "Just in time and jidoka lead to continuous flow of production.", 
    "Flexible workforce means varying the number", 
    "of workers as demand changes.", 
    "Creative thinking includes capitalizing", 
    "on worker suggestions.", 
    "Let's talk a little bit now about just in time.", 
    "In the assembly of car subsystems", 
    "and in the final assembly of a car,", 
    "the parts and subassemblies arrive", 
    "just when they are needed.", 
    "This is the goal of just in time.", 
    "If parts arrive too early, we have inventory.", 
    "If they arrive too late, there's starvation and idleness.", 
    "Just in time is hard to enforce in many factories,", 
    "because people hate to appear idle", 
    "or to let machines be idle, so they produce inventory.", 
    "Inventories are therefore not needed.", 
    "In reality, there are inventories.", 
    "They have a role, but inventories must be minimized.", 
    "Just in time cannot be achieved by central planning.", 
    "In many organizations, detailed management and scheduling", 
    "is often done centrally, but this", 
    "makes it impossible to respond to events as they happen.", 
    "Central planning exists in Toyota Production System,", 
    "but it does not micromanage.", 
    "Analogies are never perfect, but lets try one.", 
    "The role of management is more like that", 
    "of a coach of a sports team than the conductor of an orchestra.", 
    "Both make sure that their players know", 
    "the goal of the organization and their parts in it,", 
    "but orchestra conductors generally", 
    "try to remove all random elements",

    "Also, people in each process withdraw",

    "A push system is one in which production and material", 
    "flow are based on anticipated demand.", 
    "Detailed schedules are calculated centrally", 
    "and sent to each production unit.", 
    "The reasoning behind this is that everything", 
    "will be coordinated.", 
    "However, as soon as one production unit deviates", 
    "from its schedule due to a disruption, all", 
    "those that send it material or receive material from it", 
    "must deviate from their schedules.", 
    "Consequently, the disruption propagates", 
    "throughout the production system.", 
    "The Toyota Production System is intended", 
    "to be a pull system in which there is", 
    "no detailed central planning.", 
    "Central planning determines high-level goals for a month", 
    "or a week for each production unit,", 
    "then each unit determines what it", 
    "needs from its upstream units on a daily or more frequent", 
    "schedule.", 
    "This limits the propagation of disruptions", 
    "and the amount of inventory.", 
    "The technique they use to make this happen",

    "I find it very interesting that they used the term \"scientist.\"", 
    "They mean that each worker must understand", 
    "the system and his or her part of the factory", 
    "and that when things go wrong, they", 
    "must use the scientific method to determine what went wrong.", 
    "Then they correct it.", 
    "A function of managers is to guide and support this effort.", 
    "They observed that people obey four rules.", 
    "First, all work shall be highly specified",

    "Second, every customer supplier connection must be direct,", 
    "and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way", 
    "to send requests and receive responses.",
