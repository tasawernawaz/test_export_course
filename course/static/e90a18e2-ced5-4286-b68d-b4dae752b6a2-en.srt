1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,110
Queues are stochastic processes.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,020
Queuing models are widely used to study

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,280
the arrivals and departures of people or items

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,120
to a storage area.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,620
We will look at some simple models of individual queues

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,200
to understand how the interaction of random arrival

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,720
and departure processes affect the number of items in storage

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,080
and the time they must wait to leave the system.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,780
We define the capacity and utilization of such systems.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,810
Then we will consider networks of queues

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,060
and use a network model to study the behavior of material flow

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,000
in a simple model of a flexible manufacturing system.
