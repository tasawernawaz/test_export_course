1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,222
In this set of slides, we'll discuss production smoothing.

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,680
The purpose of production smoothing

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,930
is to diminish or control quantity variation

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,990
in a production line.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,830
It includes smoothing of total production quantity

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,320
and smoothing of each model's production quantity.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,460
However, production must respond to variable demand.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,160
If production is always done at a perfectly constant rate,

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,960
it will not be synchronized with varying demand.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,980
Therefore, there must be some variation in production rate,

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,380
but that variation must be controlled.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,080
Production rate due to internal factory events,

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,720
such as machine failures and other stoppages,

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,240
must be diminished as much as possible.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,910
The just-in-time idea applied to sales

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,250
is supplying products in saleable quantities only.

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,380
That means that production must adapt promptly

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,280
to demand changes and doing this eliminates excess inventories

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,240
of finished goods.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,420
Production rate variation due to internal factory events

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,840
must be diminished.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,420
If demand increases, hire temporary workers,

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,060
add shifts, and so forth.

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,600
If demand decreases, dismiss temporary workers,

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,820
transfer workers to lines with increased demand,

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,340
decrease overtime, or fill up workers time with quality

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,470
control meetings, setup practice, maintenance,

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,150
and so forth.

29
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,850
Note that the last item's activities are all productive.

30
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,320
They're not just time fillers.

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,380
Our system has a maximum production rate, its capacity.

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,330
When demand is less than that maximum, capacity is wasted.

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,960
Smoothing production can reduce the required maximum.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,300
However, when demand is greater than capacity,

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,780
there will have to be inventory or lost sales.

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,102
There's a trade off between inventory and lost sales,

37
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:51,560
just as in the news vendor problem.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,205


39
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:55,580
But there are lots of differences

40
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,040
between what we're talking about now and the news vendor

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,000
problem.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,300
Cars are sold over a long period, not just one day.

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,150
Sales are not lost like they are when the product is

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,200
today's newspaper.

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,340
Instead, the sale prices of cars go down over time gradually.

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,190
Also, the price of a car is not fixed, it's set by the market.

47
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,230


48
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,690
The goal of production smoothing is

49
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,440
to minimize the variance of total output during a period.

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,290
Ideally, produce the same amount every day,

51
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,510
if demand is constant.

52
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,910
The amount produced in a day is the total for a planning

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,310
period, such as a month, divided by the number of days

54
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,900
in that period.

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,629
The planning period should be as short as possible.

56
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,545
Consider an engine line that normally produces

57
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,880
a hundred engines per day.

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,305
An assembly plant requests lots of five,

59
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:45,940
with withdrawal kanbans.

60
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,950
Withdrawals normally occur 20 times per day.

61
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,700
Suppose demand is reduced to 90 per day,

62
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,990
then withdrawals occur 18 times per day.

63
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,580
The production process is stopped

64
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,700
after 90 engines are produced.

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,830
If demand is increased to 100 per day,

66
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,540
withdrawals occur 22 times per day.

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,790
The additional engines are produced in overtime.

68
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,676
If the engine plant did not alter their work hours,

69
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:14,050
they would either build inventory

70
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,610
or starve the assembly plant.

71
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,990
The purpose of mixing models is to minimize inventory,

72
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,530
to maximize utilization, and to minimize variability.

73
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,940
The next slides describe the effect of mixing models

74
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,630
on the amount of inventory.

75
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,210
This is a completely made-up example.

76
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,540
Over a period of 168 working hours,

77
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,090
which is eight hours a day for 21 days,

78
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,020
there's a constant demand for 56 a items, 56 b items,

79
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,390
and 56 c's.

80
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,980
a items have a 50 minute operation time.

81
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,970
b items require 60 minutes, and c items

82
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,950
have a 70 minute operation time.

83
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,720
Suppose they're produced with all 56 a's, and then 56 b's,

84
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,540
and then 56 c's every month.

85
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,460
In that case, the production rate of the line

86
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,640
changes over time.

87
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,970
For 46 hours and 40 minutes, it makes a items

88
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,220
at a rate of 1.2 items per hour.

89
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,710
For the next 56 hours, it makes b items

90
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,600
at a rate of one item per hour.

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,690
And then for the remaining 65 hours and 20 minutes,

92
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,800
it makes c items at a rate of items.

93
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,210
86 items per hour.

94
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,730
These graphs show the cumulative production

95
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,910
and cumulative demand for all three part types

96
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,220
over the course of that month.

97
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,930
In all the graphs, the horizontal axis

98
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,180
is the time in hours, the vertical axis

99
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,120
is cumulative production and cumulative demand.

100
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,200
The assumption is that demand is constant,

101
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,090
and the items are delivered in a steady stream.

102
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,970
The line produces a's for the first 46 and 1/3

103
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,400
hours at 1.2 parts per hour.

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,340
Then it stops producing a's and starts

105
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,904
producing b's for 56 hours at one per hour.

106
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:59,320
And then, finally, it stops making

107
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,120
b's and starts producing c's for 65 and 1/3

108
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,490
hours at 0.857 parts per hour.

109
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,540
Over a period of 168 hours, we've produced 56 a's, 56

110
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,846
b's, and 56 c's.

111
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,810
The production rate of a's, which

112
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,350
is the slope of the red line, is greater than the demand rate,

113
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,420
which is the slope of the green line,

114
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,700
until the month's requirements are met.

115
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,620
After that, there is no more a production,

116
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,410
so the red line becomes flat.

117
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,720
At that point the production of b's starts.

118
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,340
If you look at the graph, you'll see

119
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,560
that the line is flat until the time

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,590
when the a production is done, and then the b production

121
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,030
takes off.

122
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,510
It rises at a rate which is steeper than the demand rate,

123
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,760
and then the line flattens out because all the b's

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,520
have been produced.

125
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,640
Finally, the production of c starts at about hour 102,

126
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,950
and that continues until the end of the month.

127
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,690
These graphs are displaying the surplus as a function of time.

128
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,760
Time, as usual, is on the horizontal axis,

129
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,950
and surplus is on the vertical axis.

130
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,770
The surplus is the difference between cumulative production

131
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,630
and cumulative demand.

132
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,630
When surplus is negative, it's called backlog.

133
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,410
What's the consequence of having such surpluses in backlogs?

134
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,090
There are two cases to consider.

135
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,390
One case is where the customer, the next production stage,

136
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,730
operates the same way that this stage did,

137
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,310
and the two stages synchronize their production.

138
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,620
The downstream line would never be starved,

139
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,560
and there would be no inventory accumulation between them.

140
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,580
In that case, there would not be a problem.

141
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,700
But we intend to talk about constant demand,

142
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,410
and what I've just described is not constant demand.

143
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,860
So suppose the demand is constant.

144
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,200
That could happen in various ways.

145
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,410
There could be three customers, not one.

146
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,330
One customer only for a's, one only for b's, and one only

147
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,960
for c's, and they all have constant demand rates.

148
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,910
Or there could be a single customer,

149
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,790
but that customer needs to mix products and produce them

150
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,370
according to abc, abc, abc.

151
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,920
The third is that the product is going to the general market

152
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,680
where demand comes from many independent customers,

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
and the demand rate is constant for each.

154
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,950
In that case the b and c customers

155
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,660
would not be served for much of the month

156
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,660
without an accumulation of inventories.

157
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,945
So let's provide some inventories.

158
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:19,410
They're the same is the surplus graph, except we've

159
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,510
added enough inventory to b and c graph

160
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,510
so that the graph is never less than zero.

161
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,030
Now, we've produced large inventories

162
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,710
by doing things this way.

163
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,590
Let's contrast that with a situation

164
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,610
in which the items are produced abc, abc, abc,

165
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,880
and demand is constant.

166
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,630
So we're producing three parts every 180 minutes,

167
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,254
or one part an hour, on the average.

168
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,670
But to do that, we're making the assumption that the setup

169
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,760
change time is extremely small, essentially

170
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,410
that the machines are flexible.

171
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,040
As a result the surpluses and inventories are all small.

172
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,710
But this is only possible if the machines and the people

173
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,636
in this factory are flexible.

174
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:01,760
But now let's suppose that they're not so flexible,

175
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,730
and the setup change time from one part to another

176
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,260
is one hour.

177
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,840
In that case, making a batch of 56 a's

178
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,590
and then a batch of 56 b's and then 56 c's would

179
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,750
take 171 hours.

180
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,570
The 168 plus 3 for changeovers, assuming that the cycle

181
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,870
is going to repeat every month.

182
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,485
171 hours.

183
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,860
On the other hand, suppose we mix the parts making one a,

184
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,920
one b, and one c, and then repeating that.

185
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,630
In that case, it would take six hours

186
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:36,210
to make one set of three parts, and 56 times 6 and 336 hours

187
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,919
altogether to make 56 sets of three parts.

188
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,317
This is almost double the time for the three large batches.

189
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,400
In other words, this would cut the production rate

190
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,940
by about 50%.

191
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,520
In general, smaller batches lead to less inventory, but a lower

192
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,220
production rate for the same operation time and setup time.

193
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,930
A batch size of one is ideal, but it can only

194
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,540
happen if this technology is such that the change over time

195
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,540
is minimal, and there's enough capacity to meet the demand.

196
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,440
One more example.

197
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,020
A plant produces 10,000 Toyota Coronas in a month.

198
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,900
It produces 5,000 sedans, 2,500 hardtops, and 2,500 wagons.

199
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,920
So for example, one month is 20 eight-hour shift.

200
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,490
Production is divided equally.

201
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,200
In every shift, we have to make 250 sedans, 125 hardtops,

202
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,810
and 125 wagons, for a total of 500 cars.

203
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,620
An eight hour shift is 480 minutes,

204
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,020
therefore the unit cycle time is 480 over 500,

205
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,940
or 0.96 minutes, which works out to be 57 and 1/2 seconds.

206
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,910
On the average, then, once sedan must be generated every one

207
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,400
minute and 55 seconds, one hardtop

208
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,490
must be generated every 3 minutes and 50 seconds,

209
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,460
and one wagon must be generated every 3 minutes and 50 seconds.

210
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,930
The possible sequences to do this

211
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,100
is a sedan, wagon, sedan, hardtop, sedan, wagon, sedan,

212
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,460
hardtop, and so forth.

213
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,980
And that is mixing of models.

214
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,420
As long as there's no setup cost,

215
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,980
the sequence like this is desirable

216
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,570
because minimizes inventory.

217
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,439
But machines and people must be flexible for this.

218
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:21,980
The next set of slides will start off

219
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,580
with a discussion of setup times.
