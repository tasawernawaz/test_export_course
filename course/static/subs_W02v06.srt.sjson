    "OK, let's talk about the densities and distributions", 
    "of continuous random variables.", 
    "Let's start with one dimensional systems.", 
    "In one dimension, capital F of x is the cumulative probability", 
    "distribution of X. If F of x is the probability that capital", 
    "X is less than little x.", 
    "Remember capital X is the random variable,", 
    "and little x is a value.", 
    "So it's the probability of being on the heavy line that's", 
    "indicated over here.", 
    "Little f of x is the density function of X", 
    "if capital F is the integral of little f.", 
    "Whenever capital F is differentiable, then little f", 
    "is the derivative of capital F.", 
    "So here are some important facts.", 
    "Little f of x delta x is approximately the probability", 
    "of x being between little x and little x plus delta", 
    "x if delta x is sufficiently small.", 
    "And that is if x is in this little tiny interval here.", 
    "Of course, capital F of b minus capital F of a", 
    "is just the integral of little f between a and b.", 
    "And the definition of expected value", 
    "is just the integral from minus infinity and plus", 
    "infinity of t times f of t.", 
    "Remember, the expected value or the mean or the average", 
    "has the same meaning as it does in the case", 
    "of the discrete random variables.", 
    "Now, there are certain important random variables", 
    "that we need to pay attention to.", 
    "First of all, there's the Gaussian", 
    "or normal random variable.", 
    "The density function is given by that formula there.", 
    "And this is the standard normal that has mean of 0", 
    "and variance of 1.", 
    "And we'll talk about the more general normal.", 
    "The normal distribution function,", 
    "which is again the probability that our random variable is", 
    "between minus infinity and little", 
    "x, that normal distribution function", 
    "is just the integral of f.", 
    "Unfortunately, there's no closed form expression for f of x.", 
    "So the best we can do is find it on tables or things like that.", 
    "And here are the graphs of the density function", 
    "above and the distribution function.", 
    "The distribution function has this very characteristic shape,", 
    "in which it goes to 0 when x is sufficiently negative.", 
    "It goes to 1 when x is sufficiently", 
    "large and positive.", 
    "And it increases monotonically between 0 and 1.", 
    "All distribution functions have the shape,", 
    "but the details are different.", 
    "The notation that people use is capital", 
    "N of mu comma sigma square is the normal distribution", 
    "with mean mu and variance sigma square.", 
    "Notation is not always uniform, so sometimes people", 
    "write N of mu and sigma rather than sigma square", 
    "for the same thing.", 
    "If X and Y are both normal, then aX", 
    "plus bY plus c is also normal.", 
    "If X is normal with mean mu and variance sigma square,", 
    "then X minus mu over sigma is normal with mean 0", 
    "and variance 1, the standard normal.", 
    "So this is why it's very easy to compute", 
    "the general mean from the specific standard normal.", 
    "And that's why you'll see N 0, 1,", 
    "the standard normal tabulated in books.", 
    "Related distributions are truncated normal distributions.", 
    "And things get a little bit messy,", 
    "but unfortunately this is what things often are in real life.", 
    "The normal distribution allows the random variable", 
    "to go negative.", 
    "But in some cases, you have situations", 
    "where the actual quantity that you're dealing with", 
    "can only be positive.", 
    "For example, in a few lectures when we talk about inventory,", 
    "we're going to talk about the news vendor problem,", 
    "and we're going to approximate the demand for newspapers", 
    "on a given day with a normal distribution.", 
    "But, of course, the demand for newspapers on any day", 
    "is never going to be negative.", 
    "You can truncate the normal in a couple of different ways.", 
    "One is to simply take all the probability that", 
    "would be assigned to negative numbers", 
    "and distribute them all around and distribute that probability", 
    "to the positive numbers, in which case", 
    "the truncated normal density is given by this formula,", 
    "just the normal density divided by 1 minus F of zero.", 
    "It's important to remember that the parameters mu and sigma are", 
    "the mean and standard deviation of the original normal, which", 
    "is being truncated, not the resulting", 
    "truncated normal distribution.", 
    "And those are a little more complicated to calculate.", 
    "The other kind of truncation is where you simply", 
    "assign all of the probability that would go to negative X.", 
    "Assign that to 0.", 
    "And so we have a probability mass at 0.", 
    "In that case, the normal density and normal distribution", 
    "is the same as the truncated normal density and distribution", 
    "for positive X, but not for negative X. Again, mu", 
    "and sigma are the parameters of the original normal", 
    "distribution, not the truncated distribution.", 
    "In both cases, for both kinds of truncations, the densities", 
    "as well as the distributions are close to the densities", 
    "and distributions of the original normal", 
    "when mu is much greater than sigma and not otherwise.", 
    "That's because if mu is much greater than sigma,", 
    "the probability of a normal random variable being negative", 
    "is very, very small.", 
    "Now, we have the law of large numbers, which", 
    "is one of the reasons why the normal distribution", 
    "is so important and why it's especially", 
    "important for statistics.", 
    "So we define X to be a sequence of independent,", 
    "identically distributed random variables--", 
    "that's often abbreviated iid--", 
    "that have finite mean mu.", 
    "And Sn is going to be the sum of the first n", 
    "of those random variables.", 
    "So Sn is just the sum from X1 to Xn.", 
    "Then, for every epsilon greater than 0, what this says", 
    "is that in the limit, as we sum a large number of numbers--", 
    "that's n going to infinity--", 
    "the probability that the average differs", 
    "from the mean of those random variables, the probability", 
    "of that difference is greater than epsilon and absolute value", 
    "goes to 0.", 
    "OK, what does that mean?", 
    "That means that as n goes to infinity,", 
    "S over n is unlikely to be further than any given", 
    "number from 0 and gets less and less likely", 
    "as n goes to infinity.", 
    "Eventually, when n goes to infinity,", 
    "that probability becomes 0.", 
    "So this says that that average, S of n over n,", 
    "gets close to mu.", 
    "So to summarize it, the average approaches the mean.", 
    "The central limit theorem is another theory", 
    "about the sum of independent identically distributed", 
    "random variables.", 
    "And it becomes particularly important for statistics again.", 
    "So this is a little bit more complicated looking.", 
    "But what it says is that we take that sum,", 
    "subtract off n times the mean and divide it by something.", 
    "And then when we do that, that probability distribution", 
    "approaches the standard normal distribution.", 
    "So what it says is that if we take some linear function", 
    "of the sum of those random variables,", 
    "we'll get a normal distribution.", 
    "Let's define An as Sn over n, which is", 
    "the average of the first n Xs.", 
    "So that statement of the theorem is", 
    "equivalent to saying that as n approaches infinity,", 
    "the probability distribution of the average", 
    "approaches the normal distribution", 
    "with a certain mean and variance.", 
    "This is important for statistics,", 
    "because we want to add up a large number of numbers", 
    "and take their average and find out", 
    "that that's close to the mean.", 
    "What this tells us is how many we", 
    "need to add up in order to get within a certain distance", 
    "from the mean with a given probability.", 
    "OK, here are some examples of coin flips again,", 
    "but it also shows us how we're approaching", 
    "the normal distribution.", 
    "So here, we're going back to our coin flips.", 
    "We have a fair coin, and we're taking more and more flips", 
    "of the coin.", 
    "And you can see that those distributions are starting", 
    "to look like normal distributions", 
    "as n gets larger and larger.", 
    "In this case, we're back to the same picture", 
    "that we showed some time earlier.", 
    "We have an unfair coin with a probability of 0.4,", 
    "and we did hundred coin flips.",
