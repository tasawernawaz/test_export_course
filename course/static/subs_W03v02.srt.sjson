    "So to go through this exercise with state two", 
    "from the definitions, we have the transition", 
    "equation for state two, which is pi 2 of t plus 1", 
    "equals P 2,1 pi 1 of t plus P 2,2 pi 2 of t plus P", 
    "2,4 pi 4 of t plus P 2,5 pi 5 of t.", 
    "And remember that P 2,2 is equal to 1 minus P 5,2.", 
    "So we're going to take the equations", 
    "that we wrote on slide 13 and now we're going to put them", 
    "in matrix vector form.", 
    "So pi of t will be the vector of the pi's at time t.", 
    "P is the matrix of the P ij's, and we're", 
    "defining a vector new which is a vector all of whose components", 
    "are one.", 
    "We can now write the transition equations as pi of t plus 1", 
    "equals P pi of t, and the normalization equation", 
    "is new transpose times by of t equals 1.", 
    "Other facts that we should know is that new transpose P", 
    "equals new transpose, which is a complicated way of saying", 
    "that each column of the p matrix sums to one.", 
    "The reason for that is the way we defined the diagonal entries", 
    "of the matrix P 1,1 is 1 minus the sum of P 2,1 up to P n,1.", 
    "We can also calculate pi at time t from pi at time 0", 
    "by iterated matrix multiplication.", 
    "So P to the t means matrix P by itself t times.", 
    "This is a graph of the probabilities", 
    "of all the states in the transition", 
    "graph in slide seven.", 
    "So now let's make an assumption that the non-zero transition", 
    "probabilities, other than the self loop probabilities,", 
    "are all very small on the order of 0.01.", 
    "That means that the average time between transitions", 
    "is on the order of about 100.", 
    "Suppose the system is in state one at time 0.", 
    "Then at time one, it's still most likely in state one", 
    "because the probability of transition is very small.", 
    "With small probabilities, it could be in stage two or three,", 
    "but it's impossible for it to be in any other state", 
    "because it needs more than one transition to get there.", 
    "At times two, three, four, and a little while after that,", 
    "it's very unlikely that a transition will take place", 
    "so the system will still very likely be in state one.", 
    "After about time 30, as you can see on the graph,", 
    "the probability that the transition has taken place", 
    "already is not small, so the system", 
    "might be in state two or three as well as one, or even", 
    "others with small probability.", 
    "After about time 50, it's unlikely", 
    "that it has not left state one.", 
    "It might still be in two or three,", 
    "but it could have left them and moved on to five or seven.", 
    "Actually, it could be in any state,", 
    "but except for states one, two, and three,", 
    "the probabilities are still small.", 
    "After more time, the system could be found", 
    "in any state in the system.", 
    "The probability that the system is in any given state", 
    "depends on the transition probabilities,", 
    "the initial state, and how long the system has been running.", 
    "Now let's think about the system at around time 150.", 
    "We watch the system for a while and we observe the fraction", 
    "of time that the system is in any given state", 
    "and we observe that that fraction is not changing.", 
    "In fact, the fraction of time that the system is in any given", 
    "stated time 200 is about the same as at time 150.", 
    "In that case, we can say that the system has reached", 
    "steady state at time 150.", 
    "So formally, a system is in steady state", 
    "when it approaches a limiting probability distribution", 
    "as time goes to infinity.", 
    "And we'll call pi i the limit of pi i of t", 
    "as t goes to infinity, which is also", 
    "the limit as t goes to infinity of p to the t times pi i of 0.", 
    "But notice that now I'm saying if it exists,", 
    "so it might not exist.", 
    "Why would it not exist?", 
    "Let's go take a look at another example.", 
    "Remember the number of heads after t coin flips.", 
    "What we found is that the state will eventually", 
    "progress to larger and larger numbers over time.", 
    "There's no steady state in this one.", 
    "The probability that h of t equals 10, for example,", 
    "is 0 for t equals 0 one to nine, but it's", 
    "non-zero for t greater than or equal to 10.", 
    "As t increases, that probably first increases and then", 
    "decreases.", 
    "It approaches 0 as t goes to infinity,", 
    "but it is not zero for any finite t.", 
    "As a consequence, there is no steady state probability.", 
    "Some systems with an infinite number of states", 
    "do reach stead state, others do not.", 
    "This has practical importance as we're going to see later.", 
    "Remember that models are approximations of reality.", 
    "Everything in the real world is finite,", 
    "but sometimes infinite state models", 
    "can help us to understand some features of finite systems.", 
    "The steady state transition equations are just pi i of t", 
    "is the sum over j P ij pi j.", 
    "So this is the same as the non-steady state equations,", 
    "except that we've eliminated the t arguments.", 
    "So before we had pi i of t plus one on the left and pi j of t,", 
    "but now we just have pi vectors.", 
    "We're going to use the steady state transition", 
    "equations to calculate these probabilities,", 
    "but there's another way that we can", 
    "do things, which is the steady state balance equations.", 
    "I've written them formally here, but in the next couple", 
    "of slides I'll explain what it all really means.", 
    "We're going to also need the normalization equation in order", 
    "to define the steady state probability vector.", 
    "OK, we'll use state four to illustrate the balance", 
    "equations.", 
    "What the balance equations say is", 
    "that the probability at any time of crossing", 
    "that circle, the dotted line circle, from the outside", 
    "to the inside is equal to the probability of crossing", 
    "that circle from the inside to the outside.", 
    "This is only true in steady state.", 
    "There's no transition equation analog", 
    "of this when we are not in steady state.", 
    "So the probability of going from outside to inside", 
    "is the probability of being in states one, two, or six.", 
    "There's only one way of going from outside to inside,", 
    "and that is that we were in state five,", 
    "and then we make the transition from five to four.", 
    "So the probability of making the transition from five to four", 
    "is P 4,5 pi 5.", 
    "The probability at any time of going", 
    "from state four outside state four", 
    "is the sum of the probabilities of the states", 
    "where the system can reach from state four times", 
    "the probability of being in state four.", 
    "So that's just P 1,4 plus P 2,4 plus P 6,4 times pi 4.", 
    "So here's what I said before.", 
    "Intuitively, it means that the average number of transitions", 
    "into the circle per unit time equals", 
    "the average number of transitions", 
    "out of a circle per unit time.", 
    "The reason for all this fuss about probability transitions", 
    "and Markov chains and so forth is", 
    "that we're going to need that probability", 
    "distribution to evaluate the performance of certain systems.", 
    "So we need to calculate the steady state probability", 
    "distribution pi.", 
    "So how do we do that?", 
    "Well, let's start off by assuming that the system has", 
    "n states and n is finite.", 
    "We assume there's a unique steady state probability", 
    "distribution.", 
    "The transition equations form a set of n linear equations", 
    "and unknowns.", 
    "The normalization is also a linear equation.", 
    "So that means we have n plus one equations and n unknowns.", 
    "Is that a problem?", 
    "We're not supposed to have n plus one equations and n", 
    "unknowns.", 
    "Well, it turns out there is not a problem.", 
    "One of those transition equations is redundant", 
    "and that's because each column sums to one.", 
    "We can throw out any one of those transition equations", 
    "and replace it by the normalization equation.", 
    "And then we solve that resulting system of linear equations", 
    "and unknowns.", 
    "We can solve it by hand if it's a small enough system", 
    "or we can use various computer programs that will help us", 
    "if it's larger than that.", 
    "A system that has a unique steady state probability", 
    "distribution is called ergotic.", 
    "The probability distribution as a function of time", 
    "approaches that limit, no matter what the initial probability", 
    "distribution was.", 
    "For systems that have more than one steady state solution,", 
    "the limiting distribution depends", 
    "on the initial probability.", 
    "The balance equations can be used", 
    "to find the limiting distribution instead", 
    "of the transition equations.", 
    "As before, one equation has to be replaced", 
    "by the normalization equation.", 
    "Which to use?", 
    "The balance equation or the transition equation", 
    "is a matter of convenience and taste.", 
    "If a system has an infinite number of states,", 
    "and it has a steady state probability distribution,", 
    "there are two possibilities for finding it.", 
    "It might be possible to solve the equations analytically.", 
    "We're going to see an example of that.", 
    "Otherwise, we have to truncate the system.", 
    "That means solve a system with a large but finite number", 
    "of states.", 
    "If you understand the system, you", 
    "can get which are the highest probability states", 
    "and you keep those.", 
    "Throw out the rest.", 
    "Solving that will provide an approximate solution", 
    "to the steady state transition equations."
