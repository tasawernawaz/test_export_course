00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280


1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,810
Many factory performance measures

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,440
are about time, such as production rate, which

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,940
is how much is made in a given time.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,990
Lead time-- how much time before a part has to be delivered.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,070
Cycle time-- how much part spends in a factory.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,910
Delivery reliability-- how often a factory delivers on time.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,770
Capital payback period-- the time

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,690
before the company gets its investment back.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,619


10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,430
Even inventory can be described in time units.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,540
We are holding x weeks of inventory,

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,350
means customer demand could consume all our inventory

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,480
in x weeks.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,130
We'll be talking more about this later.

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,740


16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,590
Time appears in two forms--

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,740
delay and capacity utilization.

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,240
Every action has an impact on both.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,350
An operation that takes 10 minutes,

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,680
adds 10 minutes to the delay that--

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,060
a workpiece experiences well undergoing that operation.

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,740
Every other workpiece experiences

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,610
that is waiting while the first is being processed.

24
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,400
A machine stoppage that lasts 10 minutes,

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,160
adds 10 minutes to the delay, that every workpiece

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,880
that is waiting to be processed that machine experiences.

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,740
Machine stoppages are caused by failures,

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,200
maintenance blocking, starvation, set up changes,

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,570
and other causes.

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,070
The sum of all the delays that are

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,170
part experiences during production

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,420
is the extra time that a part spends in a factory,

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,960
beyond the time required for its operations.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,550
That is often between 10 and 100 times the total operation time.

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,170
An operation that takes 10 minutes,

36
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,900
takes up 10 minutes of the available time

37
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,220
of a machine, an operator, or other resources.

38
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,740
Similarly, for machine stoppages,

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,050
since there are a limited number of minutes

40
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,884
of each resource that are available in a day,

41
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:04,550
there are a limited number of operations

42
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,132
that can be done in a day.

43
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,590
In other words, this is a limit on the factories production

44
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,630
rate.

45
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,670
The operation time is the time that a machine

46
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,860
takes to do an operation.

47
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,810
The production rate is the average number

48
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,370
of parts produced in a time unit, also called throughput.

49
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,940
If nothing interesting ever happens--

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,440
such as no failures or no set up changes--

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,700
the production rate is one over the operation time.

52
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,520
But something interesting always happens.

53
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,030
The capacity is the maximum possible production rate

54
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,490
of a manufacturing system for systems that

55
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,130
are making only one part type.

56
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,680
The short-term capacity is determined by the resources

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,690
available right now.

58
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,370
The long-term capacity is determined

59
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,520
by the average resource availability.

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,290
Short-term capacity must be considered

61
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,120
for real-time scheduling.

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,110
Each time the machine changes its availability-- for example,

63
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,760
a failure and then, its repair--

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,340
the schedule may have to be changed.

65
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,670
Long-term capacity is considered in factory design.

66
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,470
For example, how many copies of a machine

67
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,840
will be needed so that a specified production

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,700
rate can be achieved.

69
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,610
Capacity in parts per day is hard to define precisely,

70
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,220
when a factory is making multiple part types

71
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,350
and each type requires different amounts of time

72
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,720
from each resource.

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,850
Since it is hard to define, it's very hard to calculate.
