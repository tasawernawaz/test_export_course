00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860


1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,410
The next concept we have to talk about is random variables.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,870
So to do that, first we let V be a vector space.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,300
Than a random variable, X, is a mapping

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,310
or a function from U to V. Remember

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,390
that U is the universe.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,830
So if omega is in U and X is equal to X

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,580
of omega, which is in V, then X is a random variable.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,060
Capital X is a random variable.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,280
Examples include the real number line,

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,190
which is very frequently what we're going to be looking at,

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,900
typical notation.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,480
The upper case letters are usually

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,900
used for random variables and the corresponding lower case

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,720
letters are usually used for possible values

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,190
of the random variables.

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,970
This can get confusing sometimes.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,060
The random variables, X of omega,

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,280
are usually not written as functions.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,440
The argument is left out.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,560
So in other words, we'd have just capital X

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,810
instead of capital X of omega.

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,197
And this is another source of possible confusion.

23
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:16,170


24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,960
OK, for examples, let's start off with a coin flip.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,250
So our universe is heads and tails, H and T.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,000
So we let omega equals H if we flip the coin and get heads,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,630
omega equals T if we flip a coin and get tails.

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,710
So we need to define the vector space.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,910
So V is going to be the real number line.

30
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,280
And X of omega is the number of times

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,690
that we get heads in one coin flip.

32
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,640
So this is pretty simple X of t equals zero

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,960
if we get tails we don't get any heads X of H equals 1.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,690
So there's our mapping.

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,920
Now we can calculate the probability.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,820
So the probability that equals 0,

37
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,320
which is the same as the probability

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,336
that omega equals tails, is one half.

39
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:03,710
And the probability that X equals

40
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,890
1, which is the same as the probability

41
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,550
that omega equals heads, is also one half.

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,130
OK, let's get a little more interesting.

43
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,920
Let's flip three coins.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,520


45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,300
The three coins can land in eight different ways--

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,210
heads heads heads, heads heads tails, heads tails heads,

47
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,840
and so forth.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,950


49
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,240
So we're going to define our samples this way--

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,780
omega is HHH if we flip the three coins

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,910
and we get three heads.

52
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,760
Omega equals HHT if we flip three coins

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,960
and get two heads and then one tail, and so forth.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,142
The order matters.

55
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:47,975
So for that reason, there are eight samples.

56
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:51,450


57
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,560
Now, we'll assume that the coins are fair.

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,270
So the probability of each one of these eight possibilities

59
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,500
is exactly one eighth.

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,330


61
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,340
Now we're going to find the random variable.

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,650
So X is the number of heads.

63
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,070
So now X has four possible values--

64
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,145
0, 1, 2, or 3.

65
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:18,470
The probability that X equals 0 is one eighth.

66
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,600
There's only one way of not getting any heads,

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,190
and that's to get three tails.

68
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,810
And so since there's only one way,

69
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,030
the probability is one eighth.

70
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,270
The probability that X equals 1 is 3/8

71
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,860
because there are three ways of getting exactly one head--

72
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,310
HTT, THT, and TTH.

73
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,367
So that's 3/8.

74
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,075
For the same reason, the probability of X

75
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:44,950
equals 2 is 3/8, and probability of X equals 3 is one eighth.

76
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,385


77
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:50,760
Now we're going to introduce the concept of a probability

78
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,470
distribution.

79
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,560
If X of omega is a random variable, then

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,810
the probability that X of omega equals

81
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,350
little x is called the probability distribution of X.

82
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,560
And as I said, we usually drop off the omega.

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,250
And in fact, we simplify it just to P of little x.

84
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,500
For three coin flips, that probability distribution

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,730
looks like this--

86
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,670
for 0 and 3, the probability is one eighth.

87
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,600
For 1 and 2, the probability is 3/8.

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,170
So the shorthand is instead of rating P of X of omega

89
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,120
equals little x, people often write

90
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,050
P of x, if the meaning is not ambiguous.

91
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,990
Important quantities related to the probability distribution

92
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,640
are the mean and the variance.

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,090
The mean, which is also called the average or the expected

94
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,020
value, is written as mu X. Sometimes it's

95
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,210
written as mu sub X, which means the mean of variable X. Also

96
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,850
written as capital E of X is just

97
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,650
the summation, the summation of X times P of X.

98
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,425
The mean is an indicator of where the probability

99
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,110
of distribution is located.

100
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,110
The variance is an indicator of how widespread

101
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,360
the possible results are.

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,270
So V sub X, also written as sigma square sub X,

103
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,880
is the expected value of X minus mu X

104
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,310
squared, which can be written as the summation indicated.

105
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,900
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

106
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,820
The coefficient of variation is just

107
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,520
the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.

108
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,230


109
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,420
In this case, the three coin flips,

110
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,810
the average number of heads is 1 and 1/2.

111
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,052
The variance of the number of heads 0.75.

112
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:41,760
The standard deviation is the square root

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,391
of 0.75, which is 0.866.

114
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:49,630
And the coefficient of variation 0.577.

115
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,470
A function of a random variable is also a random variable.

116
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,540
A special case is a linear function.

117
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,760
So we're going to define the function Y of omega

118
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,840
to be equal to a of X of omega plus b.

119
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,110
In that case, the mean of Y, Y-bar,

120
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,440
is equal to aX-bar plus b.

121
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,380
And the variance of Y is a-square times

122
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,070
the variance of X. The standard deviation of Y

123
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,289
is the absolute value of a times the standard deviation of X.

124
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,830
You need the absolute value because a

125
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,070
could be a negative number.
