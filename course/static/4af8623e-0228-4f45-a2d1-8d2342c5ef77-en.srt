1
00:00:00,774 --> 00:00:02,440
The first week of this course is devoted

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,710
to an overview of manufacturing systems engineering.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,150
We'll start off with a case that illustrates some of the issues.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,901
Inkjet printers were introduced in 1993,

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,400
they were much better than the dot matrix printers that were

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,350
all that was available before.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,820
They had much better print quality,

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,170
they could print graphics as well as text,

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,270
and they were much faster.

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,270
The demand for inkjet printers was large and it grew rapidly.

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,340
Market share is very important to companies

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,530
when new technology is introduced.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,467
Customers are thought to have brand loyalty.

14
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:33,550
Once they get accustomed to one brand of a product

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,924
they stay with that brand when they replaced that product

16
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:38,500
with a new model.

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,900
In addition, printer customers don't just buy printers,

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,890
they also buy ink cartridges.

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,950
This is also a lucrative market.

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,570
Consequently, companies are often

21
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,090
willing to forego initial profits for greater profits

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,020
later.

23
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,480
Manufacturers could sell all they could produce.

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,420
Demand was much greater than production capacity.

25
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,910
Hewlett-Packard was designing and producing its printers

26
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,000
in Vancouver, Washington near Portland, Oregon.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,640
Their initial production was done manually.

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,747
They decided to increase their printer production rate.

29
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:08,830
In deciding how to increase their production rate,

30
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,457
they had to satisfy certain constraints.

31
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:13,540
First constraint was that they had to keep quality

32
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,650
at a high level.

33
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,250
Quality does not just refer to the way printed pages look,

34
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,110
it also refers to the reliability of the product.

35
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,370
The printers have to last long enough to satisfy customers.

36
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,440
It was not enough to increase production rate

37
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,067
to keep up with demand.

38
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,400
To increase market share they had to increase production

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,270
at a greater rate than demand.

40
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,830
Their production target was 300,000 printers per month.

41
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,080
The capacity with existing manual assembly

42
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,750
was only 200,000 printers per month.

43
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,970
In addition, they also had to meet profit and revenue

44
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,240
targets.

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,640
To increase market share however,

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,190
they had to keep costs low to attract customers.

47
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,370
Keeping costs low is also necessary for profitability.

48
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,050
They wanted to have a stable workforce,

49
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,730
they did not want to have to hire people

50
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,100
when demand was high and then lay them off

51
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,660
when demand dropped.

52
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,110
HP invested $25 million in Eclipse, a new system

53
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,090
for automated assembly of the print engine.

54
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,199
This is a diagram of the whole production process.

55
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,260
Raw materials are fed into the mechanical assembly

56
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,140
cell, which we're going to focus on-- the Eclipse.

57
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,190
The completed print engine went into a storage buffer,

58
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,230
and from there it went to final assembly

59
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,240
with the rest of the printer, and then

60
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
to packaging and shipping.

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,870
Altogether, two of these Eclipse systems were installed.

62
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,890
This is a representation of the Eclipse automated assembly

63
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,240
system.

64
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,570
There are about 100 steps in the manufacturing process.

65
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,260
It was a main loop and several sub-assembly lines feeding it.

66
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,490
The base was assembled in the first sub-assembly line

67
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,860
and additional sub-assemblies were added to it later.

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,730
The main loop had 30 workstations.

69
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,470
When the base entered the main loop,

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,510
it was attached to a pallet which would carry it

71
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,460
through the assembly process.

72
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,440
This reduced possible damage to the product

73
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,780
from being clamped at each station.

74
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,390
Each such clamping risks damage.

75
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,020
Clamping the pallet causes no damage to the product.

76
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,820
When the assembly process was complete,

77
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,470
the engine was detached from the pallet

78
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,360
and then sent to a storage area to await

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,340
final assembly of the printer.

80
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,010
The empty pallet was sent back to the first assembly station

81
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,364
to get a new base to carry into the main loop.

82
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,030
At the time when this was all happening,

83
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,100
the American industry consensus was

84
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,830
that inventory was bad and should be eliminated.

85
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,620
As a consequence, the system was designed with very little room

86
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,880
for inventory.

87
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,190
As we will see, inventory is a necessary evil

88
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,070
if there's variability in the manufacturing process.

89
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,220
And there's always variability in the manufacturing process.

90
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,190
Some assumptions were made about the system.

91
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,900
Efficiency is the fraction of time

92
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,060
that machines are available for production--

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,640
not needing or undergoing repair or maintenance

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,070
or any other activity like that.

95
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,860
We'll describe that in more detail later.

96
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,490
The operation times at each station

97
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,070
were estimated to be nine seconds and constant.

98
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,870
Consequently, the total production rate

99
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,140
was estimated to be about 370,000 units per month.

100
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,170
But after the first two stations were installed,

101
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,600
data was collected and it was found that efficiency

102
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,490
was less than 99%.

103
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,260
Operation times were variable, often

104
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,060
greater than nine seconds.

105
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,710
In that case, actual production would

106
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,480
be about 125,000 units per month a very disappointing result.

107
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,070
They then face the problem--

108
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,860
how to modify the system to increase production rate?

109
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,320
And how to make the changes happen in a very short time?

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,770


111
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,100
The reason for the drastically reduced production

112
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,830
is the effect that the failure of one machine

113
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,990
has on all the others.

114
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,590
In this animation, the third sub-assembly line fails.

115
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,010
While it is out of action, the upstream part of the main line

116
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,380
keeps operating for a short time.

117
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,380
But the parts accumulate on the transportation system.

118
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,770
They create a traffic jam and all of the upstream machines

119
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,440
have to stop because they have nowhere to put their completed

120
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
parts, they are blocked.

121
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,510
At the same time, the parts that were downstream of the failed

122
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,750
machine are processed until they leave the system.

123
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,240
At that point, the machines downstream

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,790
of the failed machine have nothing to work on.

125
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,720
And so they have to stop, they're starved.

126
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,580
When the failed machines are repaired production resumes.

127
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,230
But perfectly operational machines

128
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,870
were forced to be idle because of the failure of one machine.

129
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,720
This is a loss of productive capacity.

130
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,870


131
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,490
Simulation is a modeling technique

132
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,520
for predicting performance of a complex system.

133
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,220
HP tried to analyze the system by simulation.

134
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,530
They consulted a vendor but the project

135
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,660
appeared to be too large and complex to produce

136
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,547
useful results in time to effect the system design.

137
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,130
This was because they tried to include

138
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,080
too much detail in the model.

139
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,990
Some conceivable changes were out of bounds,

140
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,850
they could not add labor and they could not

141
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,290
redesign the machines.

142
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,650
A visiting researcher proposed a feasible change--

143
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,366
adding a small amount of buffer space within the Eclipse.

144
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,740
Here's a graph that shows the relationship between buffer

145
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,130
space, N, and production space, P.

146
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,050
The horizontal axis is buffer space,

147
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,024
the vertical axis is the production rate.

148
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:08,190
The graph shows that when there's very little buffer

149
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,830
space, adding a little can increase production rate

150
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,575
by a lot.

151
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:13,950
This is not true when there there's a lot of buffer space

152
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,820
already.

153
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,280
The underlying design and analysis tools

154
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,140
will be described in the second part of this course.

155
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,500
Here's a diagram of the modified system.

156
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,540
There's an empty pallet buffer, there's

157
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,670
work in process space between some assembly

158
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,300
lines and the main line, there's work

159
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,547
in process space on the main line,

160
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:32,130
and the buffer sizes were large enough

161
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,390
to hold about 30 minutes worth of material.

162
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,210
This is a small multiple of the mean time

163
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,620
to repair of the machines.

164
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,930
30 minutes represents about 200 parts.

165
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,230
Here's the old system and the new system side by side,

166
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,776
you can see the difference.

167
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:48,150
When this was implemented, it led

168
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,850
to increased factory capacity to over 200,000 units per month.

169
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,500
The increased space on the system

170
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,320
is what allowed the increase in production rate.

171
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,810
Now, if a machine fails more time

172
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,260
must elapse before the upstream traffic jam occurs.

173
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,450
This allows the upstream machines

174
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,090
to work longer before they are blocked.

175
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,640
Similarly, if there are more ports downstream

176
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,010
of the failure, the downstream machines

177
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,040
can process more parts before they're starved.

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,780
Consequently, less productive time

179
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,355
is lost due to the single failure.

180
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:25,780


181
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,520
The capital cost of the changes was about $1,400,000.

182
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,710
The payoff was great, the incremental revenues

183
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,320
were about $280 million.

184
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,050
The labor productivity increased by about 50%.

185
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,310
This was successful because there was early intervention--

186
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,520
that is the analysis was done before too much of the system

187
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,500
was built and already in place.

188
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
The rapid response was possible because much

189
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,750
of the relevant research work had already been done.

190
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,630
The HP managers were quite flexible,

191
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,630
possibly because of the crisis they were facing.

192
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,130
The new analysis tool was fast, easy to use,

193
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,565
and was at the right level of detail.

194
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,065
