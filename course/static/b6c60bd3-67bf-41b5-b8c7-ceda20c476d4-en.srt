1
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:03,640
This course has a message and that

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,260
is, that manufacturing systems can

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,962
be understood like any complex engineered system.

4
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:10,420
There are two views about factories

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,160
that are very widespread.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,130
One is that factories are huge messes that cannot possibly be

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,160
understood, and at the best that anyone can do is to overbuild

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,200
them and then, react to unwelcome events as they

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,490
happen.

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,210
The other is that factories can be understood, but only

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,290
designed and operated using common sense,

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,570
non-quantitative methods.

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,700
The message here is that we can treat factories

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,990
with quantitative engineering approaches and methods.

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,570
Engineers must have intuition about these systems

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,080
in order to design and operate them most effectively.

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,580
To be a good engineer, you must have

18
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,100
intuition about the kinds of things you work on.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,740
You must have a rough idea of how the value of each parameter

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,260
affects the performance of a system.

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,860
And how different components combine to affect performance.

22
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,870
Intuition is not enough for design

23
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,980
because it is not precise so quantitative tools are needed.

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,099
But good intuition can provide a good starting point for design.

25
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,690
That starting point can be refined

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,390
by using quantitative techniques.

27
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,400
Such intuition can be developed by studying

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,246
the elements of the system and their interactions.

29
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:14,870
A goal of this course is to provide you

30
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,970
with some such intuition, especially about

31
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,150
the effect of randomness on manufacturing systems.

32
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,280
Using intuition and appropriate design tools

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,480
can have a big payoff.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,910
In the HP case described in the previous video,

35
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,630
is an example of such a big payoff.

36
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,810
The goals of the course are to explain important measures

37
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,880
of system performance.

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,460
To show the importance of random, potentially disruptive

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,260
events in factories.

40
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,850
To give some intuition about the behavior of these systems.

41
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,610
Describe and justify some quantitative tools and methods.

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,630
But not to describe all current common sense approaches.

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,730
The approach is to focus on important factory

44
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,414
phenomena that can be analyzed quantitatively.

45
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,080
We will look at some of these phenomenon

46
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,140
in a very fundamental way.

47
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,420
Also, to develop or describe mathematical models

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,010
of these phenomena.

49
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,720
Mathematical modeling and analysis

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,930
is a very important part of the course.

51
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,580
In the next few weeks, we'll be reviewing basic probability

52
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,090
because we'll be focusing on randomness in factories.

53
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,550
To study the required mathematics, only as deeply as

54
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,480
needed.

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,310
This is not a math course, but some math is needed,

56
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,480
and it might feel like a math course at some times.

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,980
There are some problems in the field of manufacturing system

58
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,964
engineering.

59
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:32,130
First of all, it's not as advanced as other branches

60
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,860
of engineering.

61
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,540
Not as advanced, in particular, compared with aerospace,

62
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,190
computers, and so forth.

63
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,890
The hardware-- the machines, and processes,

64
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,650
and material handling systems-- are just as advanced,

65
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,470
but the overall factory design and operation

66
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,330
is not quite so advanced.

67
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,100
Practitioners are sometimes, encouraged

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,770
to rely on slogans or black boxes.

69
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,630
An example of a slogan is, inventory

70
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,960
is waste or zero inventory.

71
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,810
Those were current at the time of the HP project.

72
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,314
The black box is a computer program

73
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,230
that you put numbers into, and you get numbers

74
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,990
out of without knowing or possibly

75
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,450
even caring how it works.

76
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,340
A gap exists between theoreticians

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,820
and practitioners.

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,007
The research literature is incomplete,

79
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,840
in that there are lots of important problems

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,600
that researchers have not touched not.

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,530
But practitioners are often unaware of what does exist.

82
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,990
Terminology, notation, and basic assumptions

83
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,730
are not standardized.

84
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,100
Different factories or companies use different terms

85
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,230
for the same thing and sometimes, the same terms

86
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,610
for different things.

87
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,860
I will point out some of these during the course.

88
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,820
There is typically a separation of product, process, and system

89
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,930
design.

90
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,360
They really should be done simultaneously

91
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,420
or iteratively, but not sequentially.

92
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,350
We'll talk about this shortly.

93
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,810
Another problem for practitioners

94
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,020
is that there's often a confusion about objectives.

95
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,600
Should they try to maximize capacity?

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,360
Or minimize capacity variability?

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,620
Or maximize capacity utilization?

98
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,760
Should they minimize lead time?

99
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,220
Or minimize lead time variability?

100
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,200
Or maximize profit?

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,960
And there are lots of others that people think about.

102
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,760
This diagram shows the relationship

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,060
between manufacturing systems engineering and other aspects

104
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,769
of manufacturing.

105
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,530
To bring a product from a designer's idea to something

106
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,170
useful that you can sell, takes a lot of steps.

107
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,590
First of all, somebody has to design the products.

108
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,900
Then, somebody has to design the processes

109
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,940
by which you make the products.

110
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,720
Then, you have to think about the manufacturing system.

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,220
First, you have to think about the structure of the system--

112
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,590
the architecture-- and we'll give some examples of that

113
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,749
later.

114
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,040
Then, we have to choose the machines that will actually

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,460
implement the processes and buffers that will store

116
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,490
material between machines.

117
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,920
Finally, we have to choose an operating policy--

118
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,510
decisions that we have to make in real time, in response

119
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,020
to random events that take place,

120
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,320
such as unexpected machine failures.

121
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,990
Once all of these decisions have been made,

122
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,150
then we have to predict the performance of the system.

123
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,110
This is done by some kind of modeling technique,

124
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,470
specifically simulation or mathematical modeling.

125
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,840
And we'll talk more about that in the rest of the course.

126
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,830
Once you evaluate this design, the question

127
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,760
is, are the performance and cost satisfactory?

128
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,800
If yes, you're finished, and you can start building the factory.

129
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,220
If no, you have to go back and make some changes.

130
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,970
And changes may be required at any or all of the stages

131
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,860
that we just went through.

132
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,020
The process is iterative, and we may

133
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,330
have to go through this process many times,

134
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,230
until finally, we get to yes.

135
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,206
