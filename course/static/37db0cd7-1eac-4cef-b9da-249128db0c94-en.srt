1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,050
In this video, we will start a discussion of flow lines

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,720
with finite non-zero buffers.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,280
The behavior of these lines is more

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,190
complex than that of lines with infinite or zero buffers.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,840
In particular, the production rate

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,309
is a function of both the mean time

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,190
to repair and mean time to fail of the machines and not just

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,650
the machines efficiencies, which are functions

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,430
of the ratios of mean time to fail to mean time to repair.

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,530
The mathematics is also more complex.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,470
For that reason, we will talk about two machine lines now,

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,120
and longer lines in the second part of the course.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,310
The motivation for having buffers

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,670
is to increase the production rate beyond what the production

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,680
rate would be with zero buffers, but it comes with costs.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,500
One cost is the in-process inventory, and also

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,670
the increased lead time that in process inventory leads to.

18
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,600
Second is the floor space that we have to dedicate to this.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,610
And third is the material handling mechanism.

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,970
Let's compare the consequences of disruptions

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,940
in systems with different kinds of buffers.

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,270
A line with infinite buffers has delayed downstream propagation

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,520
of disruptions in the form of starvation

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,490
and no upstream propagation.

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,970
Zero buffers have essentially instantaneous propagation

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,010
of disruptions in both directions,

27
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,860
upstream and downstream.

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,280
Finite buffers have a delayed propagation in both directions,

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
and there's a new phenomenon which we call a blockage.

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,770
Machine, Mi, is blocked at time, t,

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,680
if buffer, Bi, is full at time, t.

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,070
Buffer, Bi, is the buffer downstream of a machine, Mi.

33
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,830
the difficulty with this is that no simple formula

34
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,250
for calculating production rate inventory levels or performance

35
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,110
measures exist.

36
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,020
To get around that there are various solutions.

37
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,070
One is simulation.

38
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,430
Simulation can be accurate, but it's statistical,

39
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,220
and it can be slowed for doing optimization with.

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,710
Analytical approximations, analytical

41
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,930
means that there are equations that can be solved

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,730
for the quantities we need.

43
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,210
We can get exact numerical solutions for short lines,

44
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,889
and a special case is that we can

45
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,340
get an exact analytical solution for two machine lines.

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,050
From now on, we're going to focus on two

47
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,680
machine finite buffer lines.

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,970
The parameters are P1, the probability

49
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,820
of machine one failing while doing an operation.

50
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,640
One over P1 is the mean time to fail of machine one.

51
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,970
R1 is the probability of machine one

52
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,540
getting repaired during an operation time when it is down.

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,500
P2 and R2 are similar for the second machine,

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,080
and N is the number of parts of the buffer can hold,

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,460
the buffer size.

56
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,080
The next four slides are going to show

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,770
graphs of N of T, the number of parts in the buffer of a two

58
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,330
machine line.

59
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,770
The parameters of each example are

60
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,020
chosen so the lines have different than hopefully

61
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,940
interesting behaviors.

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,620
In example one, both machines are the same

63
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,630
and the buffer is small.

64
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,960
Example two has the same machines as in example one,

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,000
but now the buffer is much larger.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,060
Example three is the same as example two,

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,810
except that the first machine fails more often.

68
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,930
And example four is the reverse of example three.

69
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,510
It's the same as example two, except now the second machine

70
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,250
fails more often.

71
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,470
Here's the graph of example one.

72
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,460
The horizontal axis is time.

73
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,220
The vertical axis is the number of parts

74
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,230
in the buffer at each time.

75
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,030
The behavior of the buffer level is driven

76
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,040
by the states of the machines.

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,500
When the first machine is up and the second is down,

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,660
the buffer level increases.

79
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,420
When the first machine is down and the second is up,

80
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,550
the buffer level decreases.

81
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,770
When the machines are in the same state, both up

82
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,250
or both down, the buffer level stays constant.

83
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,720
We can't tell whether the machines

84
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,040
are both up or both down by looking at the graph.

85
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,290
When the buffer level zero, that is when the buffer is empty,

86
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,680
the first machine must be down and the second must be up.

87
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,060
The second one is start.

88
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,060
When the buffer level is 10, in this case, when the buffer is

89
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,230
full, the first machine must be up and the second must be down.

90
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,030
The first machine is blocked.

91
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,710
Note that many of the failures lead

92
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,110
to a blockage or starvation.

93
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,480
This is because the mean downtime of both machines

94
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,810
is 10, since R is equal to 0.1 for both.

95
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,910
Therefore, a large fraction of downtimes

96
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,380
will be greater than 10.

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,540
Keep in mind that the buffer size is 10.

98
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,670
So if the first machine fails and stays down

99
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,160
for 10 or more operation times, and the second machine

100
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,010
stays up, the buffer will become empty.

101
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,440
Similarly, if the second one fails and stays down

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,150
for more than 10 operations times,

103
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,300
and the first stays up, the buffer will become full.

104
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,130
Here's example two.

105
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,180
In this case, the buffer size is 100,

106
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,410
which is 10 times the mean downtimes of both machines.

107
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,750
The machines are the same as in example one.

108
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,620
As a consequence, starvations and blockages are much rarer.

109
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,850
Most downtimes are much less than the buffer size

110
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,800
when we measure downtimes and operation time.

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,900
A single failure rarely lasts long enough

112
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,330
to fill or empty the buffer.

113
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,220
Note that the scales on both the axes

114
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,020
are different from those of example one.

115
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,940
For the buffer to become empty, for example,

116
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,310
there must be a period starting with the buffer level

117
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,790
being 50, in which machine one is down more than 50 operation

118
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,000
times more than machine two is down.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,750
This is rare.

120
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,640
Increasing the buffer size has the effect

121
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,130
of increasing the production rate,

122
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,630
because the fraction of the time the buffer is full or empty

123
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,070
decreases.

124
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,560
Increasing the buffer size also makes the average amount

125
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,430
of inventory increase.

126
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,190
Here's the graph of example three.

127
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,140
This example is similar to example two,

128
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,920
except machine one fails twice as often as machine two.

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,540
Machine one is the bottleneck.

130
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,630
This graphs looks similar to that of example two,

131
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,020
except that the buffer level rarely goes above 50.

132
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,550
During the period shown, the buffer

133
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,020
is often empty, but never full.

134
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,140
What would be the effect of increasing the buffer size?

135
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,670
If the marketing department told us

136
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,670
that we have to meet a significantly higher demand,

137
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,740
could we hope to meet it by increasing the buffer size?

138
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,390
Pause the video at this point if you

139
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,980
want to check your intuition.

140
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,210
My answer is coming next.

141
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,120


142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,670
The answer is, of course not.

143
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,310
During the period of 10,000 operation times,

144
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,290
the buffer is never full.

145
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,690
If we ran the same simulation with the same sequence

146
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,420
of failures and repairs into the larger buffer,

147
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,257
we would see exactly the same buffer level

148
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,590
history, and therefore, exactly the same production rate

149
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,330
and average inventory.

150
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,390
To summarize, increasing the buffer size in this case

151
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,430
would not change the production rate.

152
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,980
But it would increase the cost of buffer space.

153
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,320
It would also have no effect on the average inventory.

154
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,640
Here's example four.

155
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,890
This example is the same as example three,

156
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,630
but the machines are switched.

157
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,520
Now machine two is the bottleneck.

158
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,920
The buffer quickly fills up, after that,

159
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,740
it stays close to full for much of the time.

160
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,590
It drops down to zero once, and it

161
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,200
goes below 50 far less time than it is above 50.

162
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,480
Let's consider the following situation.

163
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,280
Suppose the marketing department tells us

164
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,100
they need us to ramp up the production rate substantially.

165
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,260
We consider increasing the buffer size from 100 to 200.

166
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,060
What would be the effect on the production

167
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,010
rate and the average inventory if we did that?

168
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,960
Let's make a possibly unfair self-assessment quiz question.

169
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,509
Don't worry.

170
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,925
Your performance on this will not affect your course grade

171
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,100
in any way.

172
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,490
We're going to give you two multiple choice questions.

173
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,470
Please try to answer the questions for yourself

174
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,630
before advancing the video.

175
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,880
The video provides an answer, so stop the video

176
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,816
after the second question.

177
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:44,690
The first question is, what will the increase

178
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,340
do to the steady state production rate?

179
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,010


180
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,020
A, it will double it.

181
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,210
B, it will increase it substantially,

182
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,800
but less than double.

183
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,640
C, it will increase it, but only by a trivial amount.

184
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,760
D, it will have exactly zero effect.

185
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,460
And E, none of the above.

186
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,770
The second question is, what will happen

187
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,890
to the average inventory?

188
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,732
A, it will increase it by something very close to 100.

189
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:15,770
B, it will double it.

190
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,780
C, it will increase it substantially,

191
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,580
but less than double.

192
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,230
D, it will increase it, but only by a trivial amount.

193
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,060
E, it will have exactly zero effect.

194
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,210
And F, none of the above.

195
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,810
OK.

196
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,990
Pause the video.

197
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,419
Think about these questions.

198
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,970
The answer is coming next.

199
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,530
To answer these questions, we ran the simulation.

200
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,530
Here, we're seeing the results of the simulation

201
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,030
as they emerge.

202
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,440
This is a simulation of two cases.

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,290
One is just like example four.

204
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,390
The other is the same, but with a buffer size of 200.

205
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,600
Let's call the first one, example 4-100,

206
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,090
and the second one, 4-200.

207
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,240
The following three slides have static graphs of the simulation

208
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,550
over different time scales.

209
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,860
The initial buffer levels of both are 50,

210
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,280
and initially the states of both machines are up.

211
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,710
The machines go up and down at random.

212
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,330
To do this comparison experiment,

213
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,240
we've contrived to have almost the same sequence of failures

214
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,850
in repairs for both sets of machines.

215
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,580
The sequences differ slightly because of the operation

216
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,290
dependent failure assumption.

217
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,270
If the buffer of one of the lines is full,

218
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,550
but the buffer of the other one is not,

219
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,380
it's possible that the first machine

220
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,860
in the line with the non-full buffer might fail.

221
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,320
But the first machine in the line with the full buffer

222
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,562
will not.

223
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:33,770
This won't happen very often, because the buffers are

224
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,647
almost always full and non-full at the same time.

225
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,480
In this graph, the purple line is the number

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,180
of parts in the buffer, 4-100.

227
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,100
The green line represents the level of the buffer in 4-200.

228
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,360
The sample paths of both simulations

229
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,730
are exactly the same until the buffer

230
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,100
levels of both reach 100.

231
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,020
That's why you see only one line between time 0 and time 228.

232
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,720
As a consequence, the production rates and average inventories

233
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,420
of both lines are exactly the same between time 0 and 228.

234
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,850
At time 228, however, the buffer in example 4-100

235
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,940
becomes full, and then stays full, or close to full

236
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,210
for a long time.

237
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,930
The reason for this is that, when the buffer level in 4-100

238
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,070
reaches 100, and machine 2 is down, machine one is blocked,

239
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,670
and no part enters the buffer.

240
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,500
On the other hand, the buffer in 4-200

241
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,350
keeps growing until time 240.

242
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,110
Machine one is not blocked in 4-200 at this time,

243
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,900
so parts are allowed to go in, and they go into the buffer.

244
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,625
There brief downtimes of machine one

245
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,640
and machine two at 240 and 242.

246
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,390
Then both machines are up until time 254.

247
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,940
The buffer in 4-100 drops down to 99

248
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,060
because of some uninteresting details about the buffer model,

249
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,680
and stays constant.

250
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,360
The buffer level of 4-200 is constant at 111.

251
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,710
Between this time and time 479, a pattern emerges.

252
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,830
When machine one is down, and machine two is up,

253
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,380
both buffer levels fall.

254
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,920
If the buffer level in 4-100 is below 100,

255
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,320
the two graphs move in parallel.

256
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,220
If the buffer level in 4-100 is equal to 100, it stays at 100,

257
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,030
and the leveling 4-200 rises.

258
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,460
This kind of behavior persists, with both buffers

259
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,330
increasing and decreasing until time 479.

260
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,450
Until that time, whenever machine two is up,

261
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,840
the output processes of both lines are the same.

262
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,160
At time 479 both buffers are full.

263
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,680
After this, the amount of space in the buffers of the lines

264
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,020
are the same, and they will stay the same

265
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,450
as long as the buffer in 4-100 is not empty.

266
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,910
That is the quantity 200 minus N200 of T

267
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,380
will be equal to the quantity 100 minus N100 of t.

268
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,290
As a consequence, the output processes of both lines

269
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,080
are the same.

270
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,220
The buffer in 4-100 reaches zero for the first time

271
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,990
at time 43,650, and that is the first time the output

272
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,580
processes of the lines differ.

273
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,700
That buffer stays empty for only a short time.

274
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,280
This reflects the fact that the production rate of the two

275
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,220
lines will differ, but only by a small amount.

276
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,810
For one run of the simulation of 500,000 to operation times,

277
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:27,180
we found that the buffer 4-100 was empty for 417 time steps,

278
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,800
and the buffer in 4-200 was never empty at all.

279
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,590
Consequently, line 4-200 produced

280
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,270
417 more parts than 4-100 did.

281
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:45,170
As a consequence, the production rate of line 4-200 was 0.8317,

282
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:51,710
and that of 4-100 was 0.8309, a very small difference.

283
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,850
On the other hand, the average inventory in 4-100

284
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,680
was 83.41 parts, and that of 4-200

285
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,260
was 183.39 parts, a difference of almost 100 parts.

286
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,250
Therefore, if this simulation is typical,

287
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,389
and I think it is, you get an unofficial A if you decided

288
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,930
that the answer to the first question

289
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,870
was C. It will increase the production rate,

290
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,140
but only by a trivial amount, and that the answer

291
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,410
to the second was A, the buffer level

292
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,700
will increase by something very close to, and less than 100.

293
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,403
