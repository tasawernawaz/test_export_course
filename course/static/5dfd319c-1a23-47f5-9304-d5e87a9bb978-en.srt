00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,940
Last week we introduced variability

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,890
and discussed its impact on the performance

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,750
of manufacturing systems.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,370
This is the first of three weeks that we'll discuss randomness.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,350
This is important because most variability

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,790
is due to randomness.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,040
And we need to be able to quantify it and its effects

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,701
on system performance.

9
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,200
The approach in this course

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,550
is to provide intuition about randomness and variability,

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,440
not primarily to teach mathematics,

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,200
but some math will be needed.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,410
We define probability precisely and define such concepts

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,060
as independence, conditional probability,

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,040
the law of total probability, random variables, and others.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,800
We introduce some widely used probability distributions

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,420
for discrete and continuous random variables.
