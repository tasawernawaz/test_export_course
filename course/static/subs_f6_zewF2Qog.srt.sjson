    "which are the number of people in the queue at any time.", 
    "The arrows, as usual, represent the transitions.", 
    "And the Greek letters on them represent the rates.", 
    "Lambda is the rate of arrivals.", 
    "So the rate at which the queue length will increase is lambda.", 
    "Mu is the rate of service or departures.", 
    "So the rate at which the queue length decreases is mu.", 
    "There's an infinite stage space.", 
    "So n can go to infinity.",

    "in the same way, except 0.", 
    "0 is connected to only one other state.",

    "Also can't be reached from a state", 
    "with fewer parts or customers.", 
    "This means that all the transition equations", 
    "will look the same, except for the equation for state 0.", 
    "So let's define pi of n, t to be the probability", 
    "that there are n parts in the system at time t.", 
    "Then for n greater than 0, we have this transition equation.", 
    "So the probability of the system is in state n", 
    "at time t plus delta t is the probability that it was", 
    "in state n minus 1 at time t.", 
    "And there was an arrival plus the probability",

    "And there was a departure plus the probability",

    "Lambda delta t is the probability", 
    "that there's an arrival between t and t plus delta t.", 
    "And the other terms are interpreted similarly.", 
    "Here's the special equation for n equals 0.", 
    "The way that you can get to 0 at time t plus delta t",

    "Well, let's consider a couple of cases.", 
    "Suppose that it takes 10 minutes on the average for the server",

    "If customers arrive once an hour, there's no problem.",

    "On the other hand, suppose customers",

    "It takes 10 minutes on the average to serve a customer.",

    "two arrive on the average.",

    "If rho is less than 1--", 
    "now you can see immediately that if rho is greater than one,", 
    "that doesn't make any sense.", 
    "We get negative probabilities.",

    "From this, we can calculate the average number of parts",

    "or lambda over mu minus lambda.", 
    "From this, you can see that if lambda equals 0,", 
    "then rho equals 0.", 
    "And the number of people in the system are going to be 0.", 
    "On the other hand, if lambda approaches mu,", 
    "then rho approaches 1 and n bar approaches infinity.",
