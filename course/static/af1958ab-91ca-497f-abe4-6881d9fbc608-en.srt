0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610


1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,540
OK.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,660
Welcome to the third recitation video of 2.854.1x.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,960
This recitation video will be on week five,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,100
practice problem two.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,490


6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:20,990
OK.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,000
So you guys probably read over the problem all ready.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,980
So in summary, basically, there are two guys selling lunches

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,110
out of a truck at MIT.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,330
We're given six different time periods

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,290
with six different arrival rates of customers,

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:43,040
assuming each customer buys one lunch.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,180
OK.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,610
So part 1, it asks what is the expected sales?

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,900
This is a relatively simple question.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,870
Basically, it's just your discrete [? expectation. ?]

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,480
So we have six different arrival rates.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,730
So you have lambda 1 is 0.4.

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,320
Lambda 2 is 0.8.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,185
Lambda 3, 2.4.

21
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:17,985
Lambda 4 equals 1.6.

22
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:24,650
Lambda 5 equals 2.4.

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,295
Lambda 6, which equals 0.4.

24
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:30,440
OK?

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,870
So the six different time segments

26
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,900
are all 30 minutes long, and since lambda

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,760
is arrivals per minute, it's a simple multiplication

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,940
to get the expected sales for each one of those time

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,300
intervals.

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,680
So the expected sales of time interval one--

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:59,460
that is just 0.4 times 30, which is 12 lunches.

32
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,200
OK?

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,530
And similarly, we do it for the next six.

34
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,490
So you have 0.8 times 30--

35
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,389
the next five I meant.

36
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:21,660
2.4 times 30, 1.6 times 30, 2.4 times 30, 0.4 times 30.

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:45,190
And they are just 24, 78, 36, this is 1.2, sorry, 78, and 12.

38
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,880
So the total expected sales is just the sum

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,870
of the six time intervals.

40
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,070
And that is just 180.

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,970
So you're mu equals 180 for this problem.

42
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,900


43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,230
The next part, basically, asks us to find the optimal quantity

44
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:16,060
that we should order, given certain criterias.

45
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,570
So we're getting a little bit of information.

46
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,810
So each sandwich is sold for $6.00.

47
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,620
So r equals 6.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,670
It costs $2.00 to make, so c equals 2.

49
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,340


50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,240
It costs $1.00 to dispose, so s equals negative 1.

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,070
And I think that's all we need.

52
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,680
So when you're given this information,

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,510
the first thing you should solve for is the critical ratio.

54
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:53,610
So critical ratio is just r minus c over r minus s,

55
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,180
which is just 4 over 7 in our case.

56
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:09,100
Now, we know that mu equals 180 and the standard deviation

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,370
is one third of the mean.

58
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,110
So that is just 180 divided by 3, which is 60.

59
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,579
And this is a normal distribution

60
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,990
with mean at 180, a standard deviation of 60.

61
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,190
OK?

62
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:34,300
So a couple of different ways to find the optimal x.

63
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:41,020
So we know that the standard normal distribution is just

64
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,360
x minus the mean divided by the standard deviation.

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,090
And that is just equal to the standard normal.

66
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,280
So we want to find the inverse of this.

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,010
How do we do that?

68
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,630
So you could use the z-table and look up

69
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,970
what the inverse should be, but a simpler way to do

70
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,370
this is just to use Excel.

71
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:20,430
So if you have Excel, just simply enter normsinv 7,

72
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,410
and that will give you 0.180.

73
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,090
OK.

74
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:36,990
So now, we know that x minus 180 divided by 60 equals 0.180 plus

75
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,375
x equal 190-ish.

76
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,780
OK?

77
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,610
190.8.

78
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,290
OK.

79
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,040
Another way to do this, instead of going through this ordeal,

80
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,400
just simply type in equal norminv.

81
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,470


82
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,200
It's going to ask for the probability.

83
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,320
That is just your critical ratio, the mean, which is 180,

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,930
and the standard deviation of 60.

85
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,660
If you do this, it should just output 190.8, exactly.

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,310
It's a much simpler way to solve for the optimal quantity.

87
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,780


88
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,960
OK, part 3 we are asked to solve the expected profit.

89
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,970
This is probably the most complicated part

90
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,050
of this problem.

91
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,960
Before we start, one of the parameters of the problem

92
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,260
has changed.

93
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,550
So now, sigma is just 30.

94
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,460
We still have our mu, which is equal to 180.

95
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,150
Since this is a symmetrical triangular distribution,

96
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,490
that is just our m, which is equal to a plus b divided by 2,

97
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,920
since it's symmetrical.

98
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:07,120
So that means a plus b equals 360.

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:16,130
OK, so sigma squared is equal to b minus a squared over 24,

100
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,950
which equals to 30 squared.

101
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:30,890
So b minus a is equal to 30 squared times 24.

102
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,520
And the square root of that--

103
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,450
so if you solve this equation--

104
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:53,260
in this equation, we get a equal 106.525, and b equals 253.485.

105
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:53,760
OK.

106
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,120
So in practice problem 1, we were

107
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,550
given the cumulative distribution of a symmetrical

108
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,310
triangular distribution.

109
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,080
And since we know the critical ratio is 4 over 7,

110
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,650
that means f of t is 4 over 7.

111
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,500
So now, we have to figure out if t

112
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,000
is between a and m or m and b.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,440
In the interest of time, I'm just

114
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,660
going to tell you that it's between m and b.

115
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,820
You could try it for a and m, and you're

116
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,270
going to see that the function is not going to work out.

117
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:45,560
So this means 4/7 is equal to 1 minus 253.485

118
00:08:45,560 --> 00:09:00,790
minus t squared over 73.475 146.96.

119
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:09,030
So I think-- this is just b minus m, b minus a.

120
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,970
OK.

121
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,540
So all of this--

122
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,091
what does this equal to?

123
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:15,590
OK.

124
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,260


125
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:29,760
So t will equal to 253.485 minus the square root of negative

126
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:41,240
of 4 over 7 minus 1 times 73.475 times 146.96.

127
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,507
So our t is 185.458.

128
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,340
And we said to round to the nearest integer,

129
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:58,960
so that it's just equal to 185.

130
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,770
So now, we know that our optimal water quantity, let's just

131
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,990
call that Q star, is 185.

132
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,790
Now we're asked to solve for the expected profit.

133
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,130


134
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,150
So in the lecture slides, I believe

135
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:30,460
it's slide 12, we said expected profit of Q star

136
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:39,926
is equal to r minus s times negative infinity to x.

137
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:57,710
Omega-- f of omega, d omega plus s minus c x f of x plus r minus

138
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:05,010
c x 1 minus f of x.

139
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,510
OK.

140
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,630


141
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,875
So these two, here, you could--

142
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,250
I'm not going to do the algebra because it's pretty long,

143
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,530
but these two is a simple substitution.

144
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,810
Now you should be able to just carry it out.

145
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,770
So s minus c is [INAUDIBLE] value minus costs,

146
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,660
so that's negative 3.

147
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,840
And our x, which is just our Q right here times 185 times

148
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
f of 185.

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,040
You could just substitute that in.

150
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:48,840
And for this part, r minus c is just 4 times 185 times

151
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,560
1 minus f of 180.

152
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,340
OK.

153
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,790
So now, let's dig into this part.

154
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,480


155
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,150
So we know f is a triangular-- is a probability density

156
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,000
function of the triangle distribution.

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,250
And it's an integral from negative infinity

158
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,500
to x, but, however, remember on the triangular distribution,

159
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,230
here is a, here is b, here is n.

160
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,380
Anything less than a is just 0, right?

161
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,990
So we don't actually need this negative infinity, here.

162
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,020
We could actually just replace it by 0 to x.

163
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,950
And x is just 185.

164
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,040
So this is actually two separate integrals

165
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:48,740
from a to 185 and from 8m, which is 180, and from 180 to 185.

166
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,210
So let's write that down.

167
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,970


168
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,080
So this part, I'm just going to bring it down here,

169
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:05,185
is equal to a equals 106 to 180.

170
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:21,140
We could just write x dx plus 180 to 185 x fx and dx.

171
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:32,410


172
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,980
So if you do the integral, here, there

173
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,900
are some things we can move around.

174
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,930
So first step into the integral, so there is a r minus

175
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,080
s out here.

176
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,500
OK.

177
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,040
So this is now just 2 times r minus

178
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:59,470
s divided by 253 minus 106--

179
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,970
I'm skipping the decimal so I don't

180
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,370
have to keep writing on this.

181
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:10,010
180 minus 106.

182
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:17,313
Multiply it by the integral, 106 to 180.

183
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:20,842
We'll make it squared minus 8 omega--

184
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:21,660
oh, sorry.

185
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:31,190
We said we're going to use x. x squared ax dx plus 180

186
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:38,350
to 185 bx minus x squared dx.

187
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,700


188
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,210
So I think, here, it's pretty straightforward.

189
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,520
You just have to finish this integral.

190
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,430
I'm not going to write out the details,

191
00:14:52,430 --> 00:15:07,010
but, basically, this piece is just one third x cubed minus 8

192
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:14,580
over 2 x squared, evaluated 180 and 106.

193
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:27,516
And this part is b over 2 x cubed minus 1/3 x cubed,

194
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:32,028
evaluated 185 over 180.

195
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,960
OK.

196
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:41,090
So the sum of this and this gets multiplied by this quantity,

197
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,130
right here.

198
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,794
And then, adding this quantity, right here.

199
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,210
And you should have your solution.

200
00:15:50,210 --> 00:16:06,740


201
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:15,470
So the expected profit at 185 units ordered,

202
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,594
should just be $635.51.

203
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:23,760
