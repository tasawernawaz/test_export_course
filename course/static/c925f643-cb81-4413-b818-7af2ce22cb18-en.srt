00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,670
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome to this recitation video.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,400
In this video, we'll go over MicroMaster's Practice Problem

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,100
1 for Unit 4.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,390
So the problem is basically talking about AGVs

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,550
in a factory that are breaking down.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,090
The repair crew is situated in a single location.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,910
So really, it's just one crew of people repairing these AGVs.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,080
And the AGVs are breaking down at a mean rate of one per hour.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,510
The time required to fix an AGV has

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,550
a negative exponential distribution for any crew size.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,040
And the time required by one worker to fix the AGV

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,835
is 2 hours.

14
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:53,930


15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,920
So because the crew is located in one location,

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,210
this is an M/M/1 system.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,050
Now because you could have different sized work

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,810
crew, the more people you have, the faster it is to repair.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,470
So mu, the repair rate is a function

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,990
of k, the number of people--

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,340
a times k. a is the proportionality constant.

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,770
And lambda is just one per hour.

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,578


24
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:33,260
And that is given.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,050


26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,920
So the first question asks us so if each crew member

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,030
costs $10 an hour and the cost of having a AGV down

28
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,930
is $40 per hour, what is the optimal crew size?

29
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,780


30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:08,919
So let k equal the number of repair crew,

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,875
n be the number of broken AGV.

32
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:21,810


33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,640
So what we know right now is this is an M/M/1 system.

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,060


35
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,590
mu is a times k.

36
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,640
So if it takes one guy 2 hours to fix it,

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,660
that means he could repair 1/2 each hour.

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,160
So that means 1/2 equals a times 1.

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,220
So a equals 1/2.

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,770
That's our proportionality constant.

41
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,800
So that's mu equals 1/2k.

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
And lambda is just 1.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,040
Now on average, how many AGVs will be broken?

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,780
Since this is an M/M/1 system, we just apply the formula.

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:21,420
That N bar equals lambda over mu minus lambda.

46
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,340


47
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,121
So that's directly taken from the lecture slides for an M/M/1

48
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,620
system.

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,290


50
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:39,300
So that just means 1 over 1/2k minus 1 is N bar.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,970
If you multiply the top and bottom by 2,

52
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,390
you have 2 over k minus 2.

53
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:57,560
So the expected cost is so $10 per crew member

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:05,070
per hour plus $40 per AGV per hour, multiply

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,620
by the average number, which is this guy right there,

56
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,950
[INAUDIBLE] down, which is 2 over k minus 2.

57
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,500


58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,380
So we're looking for the minimal cost.

59
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,300
So we're looking for an optimal number here.

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,970
To get the optimum, we have to find the derivative

61
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,970
of the cost with respect to k.

62
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:37,310
So de, dk-- we just differentiate--

63
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,320
equals 10 plus 10.

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:50,000
Actually, minus 80 over k minus 2 squared.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,850
We set the derivative equal to 0.

66
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,160
Now we solve for k.

67
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,600
k is just 4.8.

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
And the problem asks us to round to the nearest whole number.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,025
So we call it 5.

70
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,680


71
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,340
So given mu equals 1/2k, the optimal number of repair crew

72
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,900
is 5.

73
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,710


74
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:28,710
For Part 2, we're saying mu is 1/2 square root of k.

75
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,050
So everything else is pretty much the same.

76
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,680
We just run through the same process, same formula.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,510
So N bar equals 2 over square root of k minus .

78
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:49,800
2 and the expected cost is just 10k

79
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,220
plus 80 over square root of k minus 2.

80
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,130
Once again, we look for the derivative.

81
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:10,700
de, dk equals 10 minus 80 over square root

82
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:18,420
of k minus 2 squared, multiply by 1 over 2 square root of k.

83
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,730
We set the derivative equal to 0.

84
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,590
You can solve this on your own.

85
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,255
k is just 9.8, or we round it to 10.

86
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,640


87
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,280
So that wraps up this recitation video.
