1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,880
This week we described some quantitative models

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,920
of single part type flow lines.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,160
We start from a model of a single unreliable machine

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,290
and then study a long line with several machines

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,880
and infinite buffers.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,950
We introduced the concept of a bottleneck

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,860
and calculate the production rate of that line.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,130
We use simulations to observe inventory accumulation.

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,710
Then we consider a line with several unreliable machines

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,910
and no buffers.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,990
We calculate the production rate of that one.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,320
These are two extremes, zero buffers having zero inventory

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,750
and low production rates and infinite buffers

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,990
with large inventories and high production rates.

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,080
Finally, we studied two machine lines with finite buffers.

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,570
These models show how buffers affect production rate

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,800
and inventory.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,160
They also show how the frequency and duration of disruptions

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,740
affect these performance measures in ways that cannot be

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,120
predicted by machine efficiencies alone.

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,890
We will continue this subject in the second part of the course.
