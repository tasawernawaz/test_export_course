    "In this set of slides, we're going",

    "Before we do that, though, we should", 
    "talk about the Poisson process, which", 
    "is going to be used in that.", 
    "", 
    "Imagine a process that repeats over and over again", 
    "and it happens at random times.", 
    "So the first time it happens is at time T1, which is here.", 
    "The next time is a time T1 plus T2, which is here, and so on.", 
    "So the time between the events is T1, T2, T3, T4,", 
    "and so forth.", 
    "", 
    "What we're interested in is counting", 
    "the number of events that have happened up to a certain time.", 
    "So at this time, the number of events that occurred is zero.", 
    "At this time, exactly one event occurred.", 
    "At this time, we have three events have occurred.", 
    "And after this there would be four times.", 
    "So to be formal about it, we're going to say Ti--", 
    "i equals 1, 2, 3, and so forth-- are", 
    "a set of independent exponentially distributed", 
    "random variables with parameter lambda.", 
    "Each random variable may represent", 
    "the time between occurrences of a repeating event.", 
    "The kinds of events that we're going to be mostly talking", 
    "about we're going to call customer arrivals at a queue", 
    "at a line waiting for service.", 
    "But there's also clicks of a Geiger counter", 
    "and lots of other examples.", 
    "The time required for n such events is the summation from i", 
    "equals 1 to n of Ti.", 
    "So for example, that's what this time is,", 
    "T1 plus T2 plus T3 plus T4.", 
    "So informally, the number we're interested in,", 
    "the Poisson process, is N of t.", 
    "That's the number of events that occur between 0 and T.", 
    "Formally, we'll define it this way.", 
    "N of t is equal to 0 if T1 is greater than t.", 
    "That is, the time of the first event is greater than t.", 
    "And it's n such that the sum up to n is less than t", 
    "and the sum up to n plus 1 is greater than t.", 
    "So then N of t is called a Poisson process", 
    "with parameter lambda.", 
    "Here's a graphical view of the way the Poisson process looks.", 
    "The horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis", 
    "is N of t, which is the cumulative number of events", 
    "that have happened between 0 and t.", 
    "And you can see that it looks like a step function,", 
    "but with random steps.", 
    "Each step, the vertical is always 1.", 
    "But the horizontal is random.", 
    "OK, so let's talk about a queuing system.", 
    "A queuing system consists of a server that", 
    "provides some kind of service that takes time,", 
    "let's say the customers that arrive", 
    "at different times in an area for the customers to wait in.", 
    "Queuing theory is the mathematical theory", 
    "of such systems.", 
    "Its main purpose is to evaluate performance measures", 
    "such as waiting times and the number of people waiting.", 
    "The informal terminology refers to people getting service.", 
    "But it has been used in many contexts,", 
    "including inventory and factories,", 
    "calls waiting at call centers, data packets in computer", 
    "networks, and others.", 
    "The purpose of queuing theory is to evaluate", 
    "performance measures.", 
    "The motivation for the discussion", 
    "here is to develop some intuition about capacity", 
    "utilization and storage.", 
    "So in this figure, customers are arriving at random times.", 
    "The service time is random.", 
    "And so there's a random number of people", 
    "in the system at any given time.", 
    "In the M/M/1 queue, we have exponentially distributed", 
    "inter-arrival times.", 
    "The arrival time is a Poisson process with parameter lambda.", 
    "1/lamda is the average time between arrivals.", 
    "Lambda is the arrival rate, because lambda", 
    "is the average number of arrivals", 
    "in time period t divided by t.", 
    "Each time there's an arrival, one customer", 
    "joins the queue and so the queue size increases by one.", 
    "The arrival rate is constant.", 
    "It's independent of time and of the number", 
    "of people in the queue.", 
    "Service is provided in the system.", 
    "The service time is exponentially", 
    "distributed with parameter mu.", 
    "1/mu is the average service time.", 
    "Each time there's a service, one customer", 
    "departs so the queue size decreases by one.", 
    "The mu is the service rate, because mu", 
    "is the average number of services", 
    "in a time period of length t divided", 
    "by t as long as the queue is not empty during that period.", 
    "The arrival and service processes are independent.", 
    "There's one server.", 
    "There's an unlimited waiting area.", 
    "No customer is turned away, although some", 
    "may have to wait in the queue for a very long time.", 
    "This simplifies the mathematics, but it limits", 
    "the usefulness of the model.", 
    "In many real-world systems, limited weighting", 
    "or storage space causes disruptions", 
    "in the part of the system that generates the arrivals.", 
    "We'll discuss that later.", 
    "Here, we're still going to be assuming infinite waiting area.", 
    "The designation M/M/1 queue is an old-fashioned kind", 
    "of terminology, but it's frequently used.", 
    "The M in both cases refers to Markovian, which in this case", 
    "means exponential.", 
    "Sometimes this is referred to as an M/M/1 infinity queue", 
    "because of the infinite waiting area and because people have", 
    "also studied M/M/1/N queue, where N refers to the size", 
    "of the waiting area.", 
    "We are going to be defining the utilization", 
    "rho as lambda over mu.", 
    "And the motivation for that will be coming soon.", 
    "This is a graph of the number of customers", 
    "in a queue at any given time.", 
    "The horizontal axis is time.", 
    "The vertical axis is the number of people in the queue.", 
    "Every time the line jumps up, it means", 
    "that a customer has arrived.", 
    "Every time the line goes down, a customer", 
    "departs because its service has been completed.", 
    "The flat areas in the graph are where the queue length is not", 
    "changing.", 
    "Those are the times between arrivals and services.", 
    "The number of people in the queue",

    "By contrast, here's a different system called the D/D/1 queue--", 
    "not a very interesting system, but it makes a point.", 
    "D here refers to deterministic.", 
    "The time between arrivals is a fixed length of time.", 
    "It's constant, doesn't change over time.", 
    "The second D refers to the service time,", 
    "and it's constant, or deterministic.",

    "than the time between arrivals.", 
    "In this graph also, the number of customers in the system", 
    "goes up when there's an arrival and goes down when there's", 
    "a departure, but it's not a very interesting-looking graph", 
    "because of this deterministic nature.", 
    "There's never more than one person in the queue.",

    "there are zero people in the queue.", 
    "Besides the fact that the D/D/1 queue is all deterministic", 
    "and the M/M/1 queue is all random,",

    "synchronized.", 
    "As a consequence, the number of people in the queue are random.", 
    "In the D/D/1 queue, the number of customers",

    "The important lesson here is that in the absence", 
    "of variability, the queue length can be short.", 
    "This is important.", 
    "Queues are expensive.", 
    "In factories, queues are really inventory in storage.", 
    "And in order to have large queues,",

    "was on the previous graph.", 
    "This graph shows the simulation of the number", 
    "of customers in that same M/M/1 queue for a long time.", 
    "The last slide is the first 100 time units of this slide.",
