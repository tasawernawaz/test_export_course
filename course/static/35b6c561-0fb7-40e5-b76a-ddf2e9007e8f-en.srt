1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,700
This week, we go into great depth about single part

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,140
manufacturing systems.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,750
Such systems are economically important in themselves.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,800
In addition, they allow us to study some important properties

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,100
of manufacturing systems without lots of messy complications

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,710
that exist in most real world factories.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,300
We'll study flow lines, also known as production,

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,100
or transfer, lines.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,080
In such systems, we have machine,

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,810
followed by buffer, followed by machine, followed by buffer,

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,250
and so forth.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,350
The machines are unreliable.

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,060
The buffers are finite.

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,970
In many cases, the operation times are constant and equal

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,710
for all machines.

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,480
The reason that buffers are present

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,760
is to prevent the stoppage of one machine

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,900
from forcing the other machines to be idle.

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,510
This graph is the production output

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,880
from a simulation of a transfer line.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,400
The horizontal axis is the time in weeks.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,310
The vertical axis is the output in a week.

23
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,250
The parameters of the line are comparable to an industry

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,830
line making small auto parts, like piston rods.

25
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,269
The customer for this product may be an engine assembly

26
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,690
plant.

27
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,610
As you can see, the average weekly output

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,890
is about 3,000 parts.

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,720
But notice that the best week's output

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,360
is about twice that of the worst week during the two year

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,100
period.

32
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,140
If their customer is an assembly plant that

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,140
needs 3,000 parts a week, every week,

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,420
there must be a buffer of at least 1,000 parts

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,000
between this plant and that customer.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
This simulation shows that, for these two year period,

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
there would not be an interruption of production

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,740
in the assembly plant if there were a buffer of that size.

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,550
Note that in a supply chain, upstream inventory is usually

40
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,370
less expensive to hold than downstream inventory.

41
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,200
It takes up less space.

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,300
Most products are assemblies, and there's usually

43
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,310
a lot of error in an assembly.

44
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,510
The first case we'll look at is pretty simple--

45
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,790
a single unreliable machine.

46
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,460
If the machine is perfectly reliable,

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,100
and its average operation time is tau,

48
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,000
then its maximum production rate is 1 over tau.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,120
Keep in mind that sometimes the term Cycle Time is used

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,980
instead of Operation Time--

51
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,250
but be careful because Cycle Time has at least two meanings.

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,280
The other meaning is the time a part spends in a system.

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,262
If the system is a single reliable machine,

54
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:14,720
then the two meanings are the same.

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,460
But if it's anything more complicated, they're not.

56
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,220
Now, let's look at a single unreliable machine.

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,870
We'll be concerned with interruptions

58
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,022
due to machine failures.

59
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,480
Actually, the interruption could be

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,860
anything that could be modeled in a similar way.

61
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,690
A machine is up, or operational, or down-- being

62
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,490
repaired or maintained.

63
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,380
The Mean Time to Fail is the average time

64
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,810
between the completion of a repair and the next time

65
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,290
the machine fails.

66
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,050
It's also called Average Up Time.

67
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,290
The Mean Time to Repair is the average duration of a downtime,

68
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,690
including the time until the repair, or maintenance,

69
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,250
people show up--

70
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,690
also called Average Downtime.

71
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,260
The Mean Time Between Failures-- the MTBF--

72
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,110
is the average duration of an up-down period.

73
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,600
Sometimes people confuse Mean Time to Fail

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,650
and Mean Time Between Failures because Mean Time to Repair

75
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,620
is often much less than Mean Time to Fail.

76
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,320
If a machine is unreliable, and its average operation

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,150
time is tau, its Mean Time to Fail is MTTF.

78
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,300
Its Mean Time to Repair is MTTR.

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,090
Then its maximum production rate, or capacity,

80
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,740
is 1 over tau times MTTF, over MTTF plus MTTR.

81
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,000
We saw this formula in one of the Markov process videos.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,220
Then we assume that the up times and down times

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,410
are geometrically distributed.

84
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,910
Now we will show that this formula

85
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,640
is true without having to make that assumption,

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,990
although we will return to that assumption later.

87
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,170
This represents a timeline of events at a machine.

88
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,500
The green bars represent the periods when the machine is up,

89
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,080
and the red bars represent when its down.

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,900
The average production rate, while the machine is up,

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,210
is 1 over tau.

92
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:02,230
The average duration of an up period is MTTF.

93
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,020
So the average production during an up period

94
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,560
is MTTF divided by tau.

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,110
The average duration of an up-down period

96
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,050
is MTTF plus I'm MTTR.

97
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,209
The average production during the up-down period

98
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,360
is MTTF over tau because the production

99
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,564
during the down period is 0.

100
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:23,980
The average production rate is the average production rate

101
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,920
during an up-down period divided by the average length

102
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,277
of an up-down period.

103
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:29,860
Therefore, the average production rate

104
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,480
is MTTF over tau, over MTTF plus MTTR--

105
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,120
or 1 over tau times the fraction MTTF over MTTF plus MTTR.

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,510
That fraction-- MTTF over MTTF plus MTTR--

107
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,220
is e, the efficiency of the machine.

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,800
e is the fraction of time the machine is up.

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,170
e can be thought of as the production rate in units

110
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,050
of parts per operation time, or the actual production

111
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,000
rate divided by what the production rate would

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,650
be if the machine never failed.

113
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,739
e is a dimensionless quantity.

114
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,280
Now, we're going to be more specific.

115
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,770
We will assume that the machine has

116
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,020
geometric up and down times.

117
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,330
This is the same model we discussed during the Markov

118
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,510
process videos.

119
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,970
The assumption is that the operation time was constant.

120
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,240
Failure and repair times are geometrically distributed.

121
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,280
Whenever we analyze systems with machines

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,260
that have geometric up and down time,

123
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,050
we will treat the operation time as the time unit.

124
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,300
This will simplify notation.

125
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,340
As a consequence, MTTR MTTF will be measured in operation times.

126
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,220
p is the probability that a machine fails during any given

127
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,460
operation.

128
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,420
Then MTTF is equal to 1 over p.

129
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,530
r is the probability that M gets repaired during an operation

130
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,160
time when it's down.

131
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,890
Then MTTR is equal to 1 over r.

132
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,550
The average production rate of M,

133
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,770
and parts per operation time, is then

134
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,590
e, which is equal to r over r plus p.

135
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,930
Since we assume that the operation time is the time

136
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,880
unit, the production rate is the same

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
as the machine's efficiency.

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,110
I will be using those terms interchangeably

139
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,650
whenever I make the geometric up and down time assumption.

140
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,710
The capacity of a machine is its maximum possible production

141
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,360
rate.

142
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,050
The machine really has three capacities.

143
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,030
One, when it's up.

144
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,460
And remember that the time unit is the operation time,

145
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,110
so 1 means 1 part per operation time.

146
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,100
0, when it's down.

147
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,290
And r over r plus p, on the average.

148
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,090
We care about short-term capacity

149
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,820
when we're thinking about real time scheduling,

150
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,620
and we care about long-term capacity

151
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,750
when we're thinking about designing a manufacturing

152
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,807
system.

153
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:43,307
