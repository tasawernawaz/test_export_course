00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850


1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,400
Consider a manufacturing company that buys raw material

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,810
from a supplier.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,180
The company uses this material to make the products

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,740
they sell to customers.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,690
How often should they order this raw material,

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,420
and how much should they order?

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,516
The motivation is the economy of scale in ordering.

8
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:20,890
We have to consider the trade-off

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,280
between the cost of ordering and the cost of holding inventory.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,200
Each time an order is placed, the company

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,360
incurs a fixed cost in addition to the cost of the goods.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,410
This motivates infrequent ordering.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,600
The order must be large enough to satisfy demand

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,460
until the next order is placed.

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,550
This determines how much inventory must be stored.

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,960
Storage costs money.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,990
Large orders lead to large inventories.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,469
This motivates frequent ordering.

19
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,010
We will make a lot of assumptions now

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,670
that will lead to a very simple mathematical problem.

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,670
First of all, there is no randomness.

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,610
So demand is constant and predictable and so forth

23
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,320
and machines never break down.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,750
Nothing random ever happens.

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,440
Also, there's no delay between the ordering and arrival

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,880
of goods.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,290
There are no backlogs.

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,790
Since there's no randomness, there's

29
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,670
no reason why there should ever be a backlog.

30
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,510
Goods are required at an annual rate of lambda units per year.

31
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,700
Inventory is therefore depleted at the rate

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,110
of lambda units per year.

33
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,620
We're going to refer to lambda as the demand rate,

34
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,330
and it's constant.

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,460
It costs h dollars to store one unit for one year.

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,800
H is the holding cost in units of dollars per unit per year.

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,750
Holding cost is determined primarily

38
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,050
by the cost of warehouse space Holding cost is determined

39
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,840
primarily by the cost of warehouse space

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,930
and possibly by the finance cost and the loss of value

41
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,950
for products that spend a long time in storage.

42
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,020
If the company orders Q units, it

43
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,700
must pay s plus cQ for the order.

44
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,990
S is the ordering cost in dollars.

45
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,750
C is the unit cost in dollars per unit.

46
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,940
The ordering cost is determined by the vendor.

47
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,460
For example, the vendor may have to do an expensive set up

48
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,900
to make your product.

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,020
It may also be affected by your own administrative costs.

50
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,330
The graph on the left shows the cost of an order of Q items.

51
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,110
There's ordering cost, which is indicated.

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,900
And after that, the cost is linear in the number of items.

53
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,200
The graph on the right is the per unit cost.

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,320
It's the total cost of the batch divided

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,180
by the size of the batch.

56
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,000
You can see that for small batches, it's extremely high,

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,720
but then it drops off very rapidly.

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,950
A problem is to find a strategy for ordering

59
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,860
materials that will minimize the total cost per year.

60
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,430
There are two costs to consider-- the annual ordering

61
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,370
costs and the annual holding cost.

62
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,860
Please look at the graph on Slide 52

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,740
on paper or on another screen, if you have it,

64
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,920
while we work on this slide and the next couple.

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,130
At time 0, the inventory level 0.

66
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,890
Q units are ordered, and the inventory level

67
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,400
jumps instantaneously to Q because the order arrives

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,690
instantaneously.

69
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,090
Material is depleted at rate lambda.

70
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,070
Since the problem is totally deterministic,

71
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,570
we can wait until the inventory goes

72
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,629
to zero before we order next.

73
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,170
There is no danger that the inventory

74
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,310
will go to zero earlier than we expected to.

75
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,090
Because of the very simple assumptions,

76
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,180
we can assume that the optimal strategy does not

77
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,170
change over time.

78
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,290
Therefore, the policy is to order Q each time

79
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,060
the inventory goes to zero.

80
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,190
The same Q. We must determine the optimal Q.

81
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,420
The inventory is depleted at a constant rate,

82
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,720
and it takes T time units to get from the full inventory

83
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,490
to an empty inventory.

84
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,260
Since it's depleted at rate lambda,

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,780
that time is Q over lambda.

86
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,890
And the ordering times are 0 and T, and 2T, and 3T,

87
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,360
and so forth.

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,290
Since the inventory goes from Q to 0 at a constant rate,

89
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,370
the average inventory is just Q over 2.

90
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,900
The number of orders in a year is

91
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,990
1 over T, which is lambda over Q. Therefore,

92
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,430
the ordering cost in a year is s lambda over Q

93
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,230
The average inventory is Q over 2.

94
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,750
Therefore, the average inventory holding cost is hQ over 2.

95
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,510
Therefore, we must minimize the total annual cost

96
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,500
which is hQ over 2 plus s lambda over Q.

97
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,200
Notice that both terms have units of dollars per year.

98
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,950
The cost per item does not enter into this cost.

99
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,020
Consequently, it will not enter into the formula

100
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,030
for optimal order size.

101
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,650
Does this seem odd?

102
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,950
We take the derivative of that total cost with respect to Q

103
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,210
and set it to 0.

104
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,746
And that leads us to the EOQ formula--

105
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,620
the optimal queue is equal to the square root

106
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,230
of 2 s lambda over h.

107
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,780
We're going to show some graphs now.

108
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,330
In the base cases, lambda equals 3,000, s is 0.001

109
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,980
and h equals 6.

110
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,890
Notice that in this case, the optimal Q is equal to 1.

111
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,940
This graph shows the annual cost versus order size, "Q"

112
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,770
for different s's.

113
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,800
In each case there's a well-defined minimum cost

114
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,990
and that determines Q star.

115
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,750
This is the graph of Q star versus lambda.

116
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,030
The higher the demand rate, the larger

117
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,140
the optimal order size is.

118
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,050
This shows the optimal order size

119
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,660
as function of "s," the ordering cost.

120
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,420
Clearly as s goes up, Q star also goes up.

121
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,630
That's because we want to order less frequently,

122
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,160
and ordering less frequently means

123
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,830
that we have larger batches.

124
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,110
Here's the optimal order size as a function of "h,"

125
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,940
the holding costs.

126
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,500


127
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,370
This graph shows the larger the holding cost, the smaller

128
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,600
the optimal ordering size.

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,310
That's because we want to have smaller inventories,

130
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,896
and we can have that only by having smaller orders.

131
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,270
Let's go back to the question why

132
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,460
the per unit cost of raw material

133
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,720
doesn't enter into the EOQ formula.

134
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
Isn't the per unit cost of material important?

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,310
Of course it is, but not for this problem.

136
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,326
The cost of raw materials must be considered

137
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:08,450
when determining the cost of producing the product,

138
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,366
and they're a major factor in setting the sale

139
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,140
price of the finished product.

140
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,900
That will affect the demand of product.

141
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,550
The only cost we have to consider,

142
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,210
explicitly, are the cost of ordering and the holding cost.

143
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,090
The cost of raw material might enter this problem indirectly

144
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,500
through the cost of ordering or the holding cost.

145
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
For example, if the value of the raw material

146
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,390
diminishes rapidly while it's in storage,

147
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,140
the raw material cost, or it's rate of loss of value

148
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,970
may enter into the calculation of holding cost h.
