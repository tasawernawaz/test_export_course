1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,110
Let's continue our discussion of the Newsvendor problem.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,990
We've expressed the profit as a function of x and w.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,700
x is the unknown we're looking for,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,080
and w is a random variable representing the demand.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,300
The problem is to find x, the number of papers

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,400
that the vendor should buy from the publisher that

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,360
maximizes the expected profit.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,500
To find that number, we have to do two things,

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,680
express the expected profit as a function of x,

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,730
and then find the x that maximizes that expression.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,980
The math is going to get a little more intense now.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,900
Please have a copy of the slides handy.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,780
I will be discussing expressions on previous slides that

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,810
are not on the slide I will be explaining.

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,360
The profit has one expression for w less than x

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,730
and another one for w greater than x.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,490
Therefore, we have two terms.

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,640
Here's the first one for w less than x.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,140
Here's the second one for w greater than x.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,460
Now we separate the first integral into two parts,

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,380
so we have three terms.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,280
Let's take a look at the three terms one by one.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,130
Notice that the integrals in the second and third terms

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,690
are just integrals of the density

25
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,830
function f of w, one from minus infinity to x and the other

26
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,030
from x to infinity.

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,840
We can't do too much with the first term.

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,820
So let's look at it after dealing with the others.

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,600
The integral in the second term is just

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,680
f of x, the distribution function.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,340
And the integral in the third is 1 minus f of x.

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,980
To find x to maximize EP of x, we have to be sure that EP of x

33
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,486
has a maximum.

34
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:36,860
For it to be interesting, we want

35
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,280
the maximum expected profit not to occur at x equals 0.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,830
In other words, the newspaper business is only a game

37
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,490
worth playing if it's not smarter to sit it out.

38
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,620
Recall that the density and distribution

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,490
functions are both 0 when x is less than or equal to 0.

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,280
Therefore all three terms are 0 when x equals 0.

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,400
So the expected profit is 0 when x equals 0.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,420
That makes sense.

43
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,275
If you don't play, you won't win, and you won't lose.

44
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:03,650
In order for the game to be worth

45
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,160
playing, EP of x must be positive for some x.

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,699
In order for this to be a realistic model of a business,

47
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,280
EP must be negative for some x.

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,190
In other words, it's possible to make a bad decision that

49
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,320
will cost you money.

50
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,080
When x equals 0, EP is 0.

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,070
That's because the density is 0 for x less than or equal to 0,

52
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,800
and the distribution function is 0 at x equals 0.

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,300
OK, let's look at the other extreme.

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,740
Let x go to infinity.

55
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,000
The first term goes to a finite constant, r minus s

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,020
times the expected value of w.

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,730
The middle term goes to minus infinity

58
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,780
because it is negative, x goes to infinity, and capital F of x

59
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,820
goes to 1.

60
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,980
The last term goes to 0.

61
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,220
This may not be obvious, because x goes to infinity, and 1 minus

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,110
f of x goes to 0.

63
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,590
But 1 minus f of x goes to 0 faster than 1 over x.

64
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,560
And this means that the last term goes to 0.

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,950


66
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,960
Therefore, when x goes to infinity,

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,800
the expected profit goes to minus infinity.

68
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,940
This makes sense.

69
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,846
If you buy a vast quantity of newspapers,

70
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:14,720
you're not going to be able to sell them all,

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,460
and you'll probably lose a lot of money.

72
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
So let's summarize what we know so far

73
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,140
about the graph of EP of x.

74
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,870
EP of 0 equals 0.

75
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,770
EP of x goes to minus infinity as x goes to infinity.

76
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,290
But we don't know what happens to EP of x, when

77
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,140
x is positive but not large.

78
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,450
There are two reasonable possibilities.

79
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,290
Either EP is always negative for x positive,

80
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,490
or EP has a positive maximum for x greater than 0.

81
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,500
So we have to figure out which is going to happen.

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,680
Here's the expression for EP of x again.

83
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,410
Let's take its derivative with respect to x.

84
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:58,100
It's just the integral of wf of w evaluated at w equals x.

85
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,230
The derivative of the second term of EP of x

86
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,530
produces two terms, and the derivative of the third term

87
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,180
also produces two terms.

88
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,510
So collecting like terms and simplifying

89
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,390
gives us this expression.

90
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,350
If we can find an x that sets this expression to 0,

91
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,190
we have a candidate for the x that maximizes EP.

92
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,360
The second derivative is given by this expression.

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
The second derivative is negative for all x positive.

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,580
Therefore, EP of x is a concave function and has a maximum.

95
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,230


96
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,140
The first derivative is positive, greater than 0

97
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,180
when x equals 0.

98
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,590
This means that EP is increasing at x equals 0, so EP of x

99
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,410
is positive for some x.

100
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,340
Since we know that EP of x is negative for some x, EP of x

101
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,190
has a maximum, which is greater than 0 for some x

102
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,270
equals x star, which is greater than 0.

103
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,960
x star satisfies the EP dx of x star equals 0.

104
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,120
The gaps in the graph of EP of x are now filled in.

105
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,740
The equation for x star comes from the DPD x

106
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,560
equals 0 equation on slide 25.

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,460
Notice that the fraction r minus c over or minus x

108
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,710
is between 0 and 1.

109
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,520
Also, the distribution function, f of x,

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,630
also is between 0 and 1.

111
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,870
Therefore, there is an x star that satisfies this equation.

112
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,670
So the policy is buy the quantity that satisfies

113
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,840
that equation every day.

114
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,930
Some days demand is higher.

115
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,120
Some days it's lower.

116
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,190
But this amount is the best to buy every day in the long run.

117
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,265
Recall the definition of the distribution function f,

118
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,800
f of x star is the probability that w is

119
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,450
less than or equal to x star.

120
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,750
So the equation in the box means,

121
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,400
buy enough stock to satisfy demand, 100 times

122
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,130
k percent of the time, where k is equal to r minus

123
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,340
z over r minus s.

124
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,670
To say it in other words, if you buy that quantity every day,

125
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,370
then the demand will be less than that quantity

126
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,360
for that fraction of a the days.

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,300
Here's one way of looking at this graphically.

128
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,260
The graph, of course, is the density function, f of w.

129
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,530
The area of the shaded region is the probability

130
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,660
that w is less than x star.

131
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,940
That is, that the demand is less than the quantity

132
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,040
we calculated to be the optimal amount to buy.

133
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,000
Here's another view of it.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,400
This is a graph of the distribution function,

135
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,930
as a function of x.

136
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,710
And it says the same thing.

137
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,700
x star is the quantity such that r

138
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,700
minus c over r minus s, of the time,

139
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,400
the demand will be less than x star.

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,730
There's one more way of looking at this.

141
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,220
Notice that the density function at x star

142
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,750
is equal to r minus c over r minus s,

143
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,440
which we can write as r minus c over r minus c plus c minus s.

144
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,200
r minus c, which is positive, is the marginal profit

145
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,180
when x is less than w.

146
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,700
That is, it's the increase in profit

147
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,370
that you would get if you bought one more copy of the paper

148
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,850
from the publisher if the demand was greater than the number

149
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,700
that you bought.

150
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,880
c minus s is the marginal loss when x is greater than w.

151
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,470
The marginal loss is the decrease

152
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,690
in profit from buying one more copy of the paper

153
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,880
from the publisher if the demand was less

154
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,200
than the number you bought.

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,440
So the rule is choose x star so that the fraction of time

156
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,680
you do not buy too much is the marginal profit divided

157
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,823
by the marginal profit plus the marginal loss.

158
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:45,323
