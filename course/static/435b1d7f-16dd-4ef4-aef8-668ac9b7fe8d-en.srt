00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280


1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,530
OK, we'll now look at some discrete time models.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,230
We're going to start with the geometric distribution.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,991
We already discussed the geometric distribution.

4
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,240
We're now going to show how it relates to the simplest

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,079
possible Markov chain.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,330
So here's a very, very simple graph, only two states.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,800
The system starts in state one.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,590
Somebody flips a bias coin or spins a spinner.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,930
If it shows heads with probability p,

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,610
the system goes to 0.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,221
If not it stays at 1.

12
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:31,970
Using the results that we've already seen,

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,250
we can calculate the probability that the system is

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,860
in state one or state two at any time greater than

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,940
or equal to 1.

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,460
So p is the conditional probability

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,500
that the system is in state 0 at time t

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,700
plus 1, given that it's in state 0 at time t.

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,180
Then formally little p is the probability

20
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,790
that alpha of t plus 1 equals 0 given alpha of t

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,790
equals 1, where alpha represents the state of the system.

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,810
Let pi of alpha comma t be the probability of being

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,810
in state alpha at time t.

24
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,440
Then we have this transition equation.

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,250
So what does this say?

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,980
It says that pi of 0t plus 1, that's

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,040
the probability of the system being in state 0

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,780
at time t plus 1, the probability

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,860
of finding the system in state 0 at time t plus 1

30
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,120
is equal to the sum of 2 terms.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,310
The first one is the probability that we went from 1 to 0.

32
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,610
So it's the probability of being in state 0 at time t

33
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,120
plus 1, given that it was in state 1 at time t,

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,390
times the probability it was in state 1 at time t.

35
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,700
Plus the second term, which is the probability

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,300
of going from state 0 to state 0 in one time step.

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,760
That's the probability that the state is 0 at time t

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,090
plus delta-t given that it was 0 at time t,

39
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,890
times the probability was 0 in time t.

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,950
Well, the probability of being in state 0 at time t plus 1,

41
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,950
given that it was in state 1 at time t is just p.

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,500
That equation becomes the first equation of the pair

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
that I've written here.

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,010
That first transition probability,

45
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,410
p of alpha t plus 1 equals 0 given alpha of t

46
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,850
equals 1 is just lower-case p.

47
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,830
The second, the probability of going

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,530
from 0 to 0, that probability is just 1.

49
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,010
Once you're in 0, you don't leave 0.

50
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,500
So the first equation is just the transition equation

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,670
for state 0.

52
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,070
The second equation, derived similarly,

53
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,160
is the transition equation for state 1.

54
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,690
The probability of being in state 1 at time t plus 1

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,210
is equal to the probability of being in state 1

56
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,420
at time t times the probability of not leaving state 1, which

57
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,310
is just 1 minus t.

58
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,030
And the probability of going from 0 to 1 is 0.

59
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,540
So these are the two transition equations.

60
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,540
And of course there's the normalization equation pi

61
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,620
of one comma t plus pi of 0 comma t equals 1.

62
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,930
So let's assume that pi of 1 comma 0

63
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,570
equals 1-- that is that with probability 1

64
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,790
the system is in state 1.

65
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,300
We can solve those equations and we get pi of 0 comma t

66
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,320
equals 1 minus 1 minus p to the t.

67
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,100
And pi of one comma t is just 1 minus p to the t.

68
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,160
So clearly those two add up to 1.

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,020
Normally we don't try to calculate

70
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,070
time-varying solutions of transition equations.

71
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,100
For more complex systems this is a very hard calculation.

72
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,060
So here are the graphs of pi 0 comma t and pi 1 comma t.

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,940
Notice that we're approaching a steady state.

74
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,030
As t gets larger and larger, both of those probabilities

75
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,520
approach finite values.

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,680
Pi 1 comma t approaches 0, and pi 0 comma t approaches 1.

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,520
We've shown that the probability that the state goes from 1 to 0

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,020
at time t is just p of t equals 1 minus p

79
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,250
to the t minus 1 times p.

80
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,500
The mean time to go from 1 to 0 is then

81
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,010
t-bar which is the sum of tp of t,

82
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,529
t going from 1 to infinity, which is the sum of t times

83
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:24,040
1 minus p to the t minus 1 times p sum from 1 to infinity.

84
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,110
It's not hard to show that t-bar is simply 1 over p.

85
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,520
So the average time to go from state 1 to state 0

86
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,070
is the inverse of that transition probability.

87
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,895
So if the transition probability of leaving state 1

88
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:43,960
and going as they 0 is 0.1 in a given step,

89
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,400
then the average time to go from 1 to 0 is 10.

90
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,580
The next example is the unreliable machine.

91
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,570
So this is a generalization of the geometric process.

92
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,840
Because now the system can go from 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,440
This is the simplest model of an unreliable machine where

94
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,270
state 1 means the machine is working

95
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,240
and state 0 means that the machine is under repair.

96
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,129
We're making lots of simplifying assumptions in this model.

97
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,670
For example, there are always parts available for the machine

98
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,440
to work on, and there's always space

99
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,304
to put the parts after the operation.

100
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,220
Another assumption is that when the machine is

101
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,120
operational or up, it produces one part per time unit.

102
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,180
In other words, we use the operation time

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,580
as the time unit, and we assume it is constant.

104
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,940
During a time unit when the machine is working on a part,

105
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,660
it will fail with probability p and go to state 0.

106
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,730
From the analysis of the previous model,

107
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,860
the time from when it arrives at state 1

108
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,170
to when it goes to state 0 is geometrically

109
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,900
distributed with parameter p.

110
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,180
The average time between arriving at state 1

111
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,910
and leaving state 1 is 1 over p.

112
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,590
When the machine is in state 0, it

113
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,140
is not operational and is undergoing a repair

114
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,970
or it's down.

115
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,070
We assume that the probability that that repair is

116
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,950
completed in a time unit is r.

117
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,320
The average time it takes to complete the repair as 1

118
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,950
over r.

119
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,594
The probability distribution satisfies these two equations.

120
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:12,760
It's not hard to show that these two expressions are

121
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,100
the solutions of those equations.

122
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,320
One thing you should notice about them

123
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,360
is that they both involve 1 minus p minus r to the t.

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,000
Since p and r both between 0 and 1,

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,270
that quantity is between minus 1 and plus 1.

126
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,980
When we raise it to the power t as t gets large,

127
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,450
that quantity gets smaller and smaller.

128
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,920
So eventually both probabilities approach limits.

129
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,460
Those limits are pi of 0 comma t, which

130
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,530
is the probability that the machine is down approaches

131
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,810
p over r plus p and pi of 1 comma t approaches

132
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,580
r over r plus p.

133
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,300
These expressions from pi 0 and pi 1 and the limit

134
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,504
are exactly the solutions of the steady-state transition

135
00:06:58,504 --> 00:06:59,920
equations which are written below.

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,600


137
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,790
If a machine makes one part per time unit

138
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,940
when it's operational, it's average production rate is just

139
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,790
pi of 1, the probability that it's

140
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,060
in state 1, which we've said is r over r plus p.

141
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,850
This quantity is called the efficiency of the machine.

142
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,360
If the machine makes one part per time unit

143
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,510
when it's operational, it's average production rate

144
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,090
is 1 over tau times are r over r plus p, or 1 over tau times e.

145
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,750
We can also write that e is equal to MTTF over MTTF

146
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,150
plus MTTR, where MTTF is the mean time to fail,

147
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,460
and MTTR is the mean time to repair.

148
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,860
We will show later that this formula does not

149
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,220
depend on the assumption of geometric up times

150
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,640
and geometric down times.
