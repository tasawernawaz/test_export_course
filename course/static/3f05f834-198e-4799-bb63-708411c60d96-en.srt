00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140


1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,820
Now, we're going to analyze the behavior of the M/M/1 queue

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,640
by Markov process modeling as we have described

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,020
in general terms earlier.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,900
The transition graph is shown here.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,060
In this graph, the circles, as usual,

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,810
represent the states of the system,

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,590
which are the number of people in the queue at any time.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,440
The arrows, as usual, represent the transitions.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,060
And the Greek letters on them represent the rates.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,290
Lambda is the rate of arrivals.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,140
So the rate at which the queue length will increase is lambda.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,010
Mu is the rate of service or departures.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,400
So the rate at which the queue length decreases is mu.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,580
There's an infinite stage space.

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,350
So n can go to infinity.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,200
This is because we've assumed an infinite waiting room.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,760
This means that they are going to be

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,220
an infinite number of equations and an infinite number

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,907
of unknowns to solve.

20
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:56,240
This means there will be an infinite number of equations

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,520
to solve for an infinite number of unknowns.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,370
The state is the event that there's

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,077
a given number of people in the queue at any time.

24
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,410
All the states are connected with the neighboring states

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,750
in the same way, except 0.

26
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,360
0 is connected to only one other state.

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,874
When n equals 0, n cannot decrease.

28
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,290
Also can't be reached from a state

29
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,807
with fewer parts or customers.

30
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,640
This means that all the transition equations

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,550
will look the same, except for the equation for state 0.

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,240
So let's define pi of n, t to be the probability

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,030
that there are n parts in the system at time t.

34
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,480
Then for n greater than 0, we have this transition equation.

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,780
So the probability of the system is in state n

36
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,380
at time t plus delta t is the probability that it was

37
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,160
in state n minus 1 at time t.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,890
And there was an arrival plus the probability

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,710
that it was in state n plus 1 at time t.

40
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,320
And there was a departure plus the probability

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,570
that the system was in state n at time t.

42
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,940
And there was neither an arrival nor a departure.

43
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,650
So the first term is pi of n minus 1, t, lambda delta t.

44
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,210
Lambda delta t is the probability

45
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,690
that there's an arrival between t and t plus delta t.

46
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,539
And the other terms are interpreted similarly.

47
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,790
Here's the special equation for n equals 0.

48
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,390
The way that you can get to 0 at time t plus delta t

49
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,470
is either from 1 at time t with a departure

50
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,560
or 0 at time t with no arrival.

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,320
So let's analyze these equations by turning them

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,776
into differential equations.

53
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:30,650
Let's analyze these equations by turning them

54
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,520
into differential equations.

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,260
In the first one, we'll subtract pi of n, t from both sides

56
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,690
and then divide both sides by delta t.

57
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,880
In the second one, we're going to subtract pi of 0,

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,590
t from both sides and divide both sides by delta t.

59
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,170
So the first equation becomes this, the derivative

60
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,370
of the probability over time of pi of n,

61
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,730
t given by the right-hand side.

62
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,190
And the special case for n equals

63
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,730
0 is given by this equation.

64
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,100


65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,800
If a steady state distribution exists,

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
it satisfies these equations which

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,610
are the same as the ones above where

68
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,920
the derivatives are set to 0.

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,460
Why do I say "if a steady state distribution exists?"

70
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,777
Well, let's consider a couple of cases.

71
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:18,360
Suppose that it takes 10 minutes on the average for the server

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,910
to take care of each customer.

73
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,540
If customers arrive once an hour, there's no problem.

74
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,809
The server will be idle for most of the time.

75
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:28,350
Most of the time, there'll be no more

76
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,120
than a handful of customers.

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,370
If we watch the system for a long time,

78
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,460
there will be more than, say, 30 customers in the system

79
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,410
for very, very infrequently.

80
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,940
On the other hand, suppose customers

81
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,040
arrive once every five minutes.

82
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,050
It takes 10 minutes on the average to serve a customer.

83
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,050
So for every customer that departs,

84
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,795
two arrive on the average.

85
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,920
Consequently, the number of customers in the system

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,010
grows by one every 10 minutes on the average.

87
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,350
This is not a system in steady state.

88
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,170
The mean of the probability distribution changes over time.

89
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,560


90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,972
In this simulation, the arrival rate exceeds the service rate.

91
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:09,930
The graph is drawn a bit differently because we

92
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,346
know what's going to happen.

93
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:12,720
The number of people in the queue

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,950
is going to grow very large over time.

95
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,610
So we have a larger vertical scale.

96
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,519
In addition, we know the basic behavior.

97
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,130
So the average number in the queue is not a constant,

98
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,220
but it's something which is increasing over time.

99
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,560
So you can see that the simulation graph roughly

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,540
tracks the average.

101
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,559
But it's not exactly on top of it.

102
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,850
As you know, there's a lot of randomness in the system.

103
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,600


104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,234
So this shows that you need to have the arrival rate less

105
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,150
than the service rate.

106
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,900


107
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,440
As we said earlier, we're defining rho as lambda over mu.

108
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,360
The equations on the previous slide

109
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,420
are satisfied by this equation, pi of n

110
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,660
equals 1 minus rho times rho to the n for n greater than

111
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,670
or equal to 0.

112
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,100
If rho is less than 1--

113
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,024
now you can see immediately that if rho is greater than one,

114
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:11,190
that doesn't make any sense.

115
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,470
We get negative probabilities.

116
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,550
And we're not allowed to have negative probabilities.

117
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,250
From this, we can calculate the average number of parts

118
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,640
in the system, which is rho over 1 minus rho,

119
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,880
or lambda over mu minus lambda.

120
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,360
From this, you can see that if lambda equals 0,

121
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,220
then rho equals 0.

122
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,310
And the number of people in the system are going to be 0.

123
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,800
On the other hand, if lambda approaches mu,

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,920
then rho approaches 1 and n bar approaches infinity.

125
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,990
So mu is the upper bound for lambda to make any sense.

126
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,960
In other words, for this system, mu

127
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,140
is the capacity, the maximum rate of flow

128
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,760
that the system can handle.

129
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,720
Rho is called the utilization of the system

130
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,180
because rho represents the fraction of time

131
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,657
that the system is busy.

132
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,240
In the next set of slides, we're going

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,820
to examine this relationship and look

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,850
at the qualitative behavior that it implies

135
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,500
about the behavior of a queuing system,

136
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,020
and see if we can extract some lessons about how

137
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,080
to manage your factory.

138
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,128
