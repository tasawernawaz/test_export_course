0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570


1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,440
The first important example of a continuous time Markov chain

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,080
is the exponential random variable.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,150
The exponential random variable T

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,830
is the time to move from state 0 to state 1 in this figure.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,680
It is qualitatively and quantitatively similar

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,420
to geometric random variable.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,980
We start in state 1 and after some time, we go to state 0.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,860
So you can't have a simpler Markov chain than that.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,060
Let's derive the transition equations

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,600
for this simple chain.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,680
Pi of 0 at time t plus delta t is the probability

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,820
that you make the transition from 1 at time t to 0 at time t

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,900
plus delta t times the probability of being in state 1

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,445
at time t plus the probability of making the transition from 0

15
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:53,700
at t to 0 at t plus delta t times the probability

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,846
that the system was in state 0 at time t.

17
00:00:56,846 --> 00:01:01,260
Writing it with a more compact notation, we just have pi of 0,

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,430
t plus delta t is mu delta t pi 1, t

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,750
plus pi 0, t plus little o.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,220
The transition probability from 1 to 0 in an interval of length

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,140
delta t is mu delta t.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,480
That accounts for the first term on the right side

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,190
of the equation.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,970
The transition probability from 0 at t to 0 at t plus delta t

25
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,510
is simply 1 in this case, because once you get into state

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,310
0, you stay in state 0.

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,290
So the coefficient of pi 0t in that equation is simply 1.

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,840
So turning that into a differential equation

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,270
by subtracting pi 0t from both sides and dividing by delta t,

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,470
we get the derivative.

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,360
So d pi 0t dt is equal to mu pi 1, t.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,870
Let's develop the equation for state 1.

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,800
The probability of being in state 1 at time t plus delta t

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
is the sum of two terms.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,810
The first one is the probability of finding the system in state

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,095
1 at time t plus delta t-- given that it was in state 1 at time

37
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:09,180
t-- times the probability of it being in state 1 at time t plus

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,540
the probability that the system was in state 1 at time t plus

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,960
delta t-- given that it was in state 0 at time t--

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,675
times the probability of finding the system in state 0

41
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,060
at time t.

42
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,215
That just becomes the right side is 1 minus mu delta

43
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:28,110
t times pi of 1, t.

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,020
That's the first term, because the probability

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,860
of going from state 1 to state 1 is the probability

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,540
of not leaving state 1.

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,930
So that coefficient is just 1 minus mu delta t.

48
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,314
The probability of going from state 0 to state 1 is 0.

49
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:43,980
You can't do it.

50
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,390
That's the way we define the problem.

51
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,280
So there is no term for pi of 0, t.

52
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,725
So that just reduces down to d pi dt equals minus mu pi of 1,

53
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,690
t.

54
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,690
So let's put them together.

55
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,450
There are the two transition equations.

56
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,820
Note that the sum of the two equations is zero.

57
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,500
The solution to those equations is very simple

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,110
if the initial condition is that we start the system in state 1.

59
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,480
So that means pi of 0, 0 equals 0 and pi of 1, 0 equals 1.

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,435
Then pi of 1, t e to the minus mu t and pi of 1,

61
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,160
t is equal to 1 minus e to the minus mu t,

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,760
and the two probabilities always sum to 1.

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,290
Now, let's talk about exactly when that transition takes

64
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:32,790
place.

65
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,380
What's the probability distribution

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,940
of when it happens?

67
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,180
That probability is equal to the probability

68
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,830
that it was in state 1 at time t and state 0 at time t

69
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,620
plus delta t, which is approximately

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,590
equal to the probability that the system is in state 0

71
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,100
at time t plus delta t, given that it was in state 1

72
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,270
at time t, times the probability of it being in state 1

73
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,020
at time t, which is just mu delta t times e to the minus mu

74
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,660
t.

75
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,560
The exponential density function is, therefore, f of t

76
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,920
is mu e to the minus mu t for t greater than 0.

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,800
And, of course, 0 for t less than 0.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,530
The time of that transition, the transition from 1 to 0,

79
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,920
is said to be exponentially distributed with rate mu.

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,580
The expected transition time is 1

81
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,800
over mu, which is the integral from 0 to infinity of te

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,530
to the minus mu t.

83
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,980
So the exponential density function

84
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,620
is mu e to the minus mu t, for t greater than

85
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,980
or equal to 0 and 0 otherwise.

86
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,860
The cumulative distribution function--

87
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,950
just the integral of that-- is 1 minus e

88
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,740
to the minus mu t, for t greater than or equal to 0 and 0

89
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,960
otherwise.

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
We already calculated the mean.

91
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,670
We can calculate the variance, that's 1 over mu squared.

92
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,270
So the standard deviation is the same as the mean, 1 over mu.

93
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,420
So the coefficient of variation is equal to 1.

94
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,930
And here are the graphs of the density and the distribution

95
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,550
function.

96
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,320
Suppose you have a process that you think

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,810
is exponentially distributed and you

98
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,240
collect some samples of when the transition takes place.

99
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,150
We'll see sometimes, the transition

100
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,920
takes place very soon.

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,150
Sometimes it takes a longer time.

102
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,970
But if we don't take very many samples,

103
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,740
we'll get a histogram that looks like the one in the figure.

104
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,500
That doesn't look much like the exponential distribution,

105
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,870
and that's because we took very few samples.

106
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,880
If we took more, it would look more

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,260
like that exponential distribution.

108
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,080
So keep that in mind when you take a small number of samples.

109
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,610
In fact, there's a large number of distributions

110
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,430
that have a density function that sort of qualitatively

111
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,142
look like the exponential distribution.

112
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,600
If you only take a few samples, you

113
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,630
may not be able to distinguish one from the other.

114
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,880
So if you're only planning to take a few samples,

115
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,290
then the exponential distribution

116
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,600
is probably a pretty good stand-in for anything

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
that has that general shape.

118
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,519


119
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,060
So there are a few properties of the exponential distribution

120
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,630
that you should keep in mind.

121
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,030
The first one is memorylessness.

122
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,830
We talked about this earlier.

123
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,690
The probability that the transition time, T, is greater

124
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,770
than little t plus x, given that it's greater than x,

125
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,170
is equal to the probability that the transition

126
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,390
time is greater than t.

127
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,480
In effect, what we're saying is that if the transition hadn't

128
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,890
taken place by time x, then the time

129
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,140
that it will take place in the future

130
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,170
is distributed just the same as the exponential distribution

131
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,150
starting at time 0.

132
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,500
So you don't remember anything that happened

133
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,360
or that nothing happened before time x.

134
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,640
The time of the transition is given this way.

135
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,230
The probability that the time of the transition is between t

136
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,760
and t plus delta t, given that it hadn't taken place

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,030
by time T, is just mu delta t for small delta t.

138
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,540
OK, here's another one.

139
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,650
Let's suppose we have n exponentially-distributed

140
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,050
random variables with parameters mu 1 to mu n.

141
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,720
And we define a new random variable,

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
which is T, which is the minimum of all those random variables.

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
So that is the time of the first event that

144
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,450
takes place, the first time that one of those processes

145
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,860
makes its transition.

146
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,800
What's the probability distribution of T?

147
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,560
Well, it turns out the T is an exponentially-distributed

148
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,020
random variable with parameter mu

149
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,030
equals the sum of the mus of each of those individual ones.

150
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,460
Now, that's important when we think about the transition

151
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,880
graph that we started with in this section.

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,200
So the time that the system stays in any given state

153
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,400
is exponentially distributed, because it leaves that state

154
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,190
to different other states with times that

155
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,830
are exponentially-distributed.

156
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,660
Let's use the exponential distribution

157
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,840
to describe a model that's a little closer to the mission

158
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,460
of the course, which is to talk about manufacturing systems.

159
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,880
Let's take two exponential distributions

160
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,150
and represent the transitions from up to down

161
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,400
and down to up in a machine.

162
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,730
So the time to make the transition from up to down

163
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,000
is exponentially-distributed with parameter p.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
The time to make the transition from

165
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,200
down to up is also exponentially-distributed,

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,429
this time with parameter r.

167
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,039
This is going to be similar to the geometric

168
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,340
unreliable machine model.

169
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,169
But, of course, in continuous time.

170
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,710
So again, we invoke the law of total probability.

171
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,090
The probability that the machine is up at time t

172
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,750
plus delta t is equal to the probability

173
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,450
that the machine is up at time t plus delta t, given

174
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,090
that machine is up at time t times

175
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,220
the probability that the machine was up at time t

176
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,940
plus the probability that the machine is up at time t

177
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,270
plus delta t, given that it was down at time t times

178
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,560
the probability it was down at time t plus little o.

179
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,817
And similarly for the other probability

180
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,900
we care about, the probability that the machine is

181
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,490
down at time t plus delta t.

182
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,130
So we'll use this notation, pi 1,

183
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,010
t is the probably that the machine is up at time t.

184
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:27,230
Pi 0, t is the probability that the machine is down at time t.

185
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,210
So the conditional probability that the machine

186
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,540
is up at time t plus delta t, given that it was up at time t,

187
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,850
is 1 minus p delta t.

188
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,760
That's the probability that it didn't leave state 1.

189
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,380
The probability that it's up at time t

190
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,900
plus delta t, given that it was down at time t,

191
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,130
is just r delta t.

192
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,740
Therefore, that becomes pi of 1, t

193
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,710
plus delta t equals 1 minus p delta t

194
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:01,970
pi of 1, t plus r delta t pi of 0, t plus little o.

195
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,195
And similarly, for pi of 0, t plus delta t.

196
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:07,710


197
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,680
We can get ready to create a derivative by subtracting

198
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,369
pi of 1, t from both sides.

199
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:14,910
Now, we're going to divide by delta t

200
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,030
and take the limit as delta t goes to 0.

201
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,680
So here's the difference quotient.

202
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,850
And we take the limit and we get the pi 1, t dt

203
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,850
is equal to pi of 0, t r minus pi of 1, t p.

204
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,380
And we have a similar equation for d pi dt of 0, t.

205
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,590
Notice again that the two equations add up to 0.

206
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,870
We can solve that system of two linear differential

207
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,140
equations and two unknowns and we get pi of 0,

208
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,060
t equals p over r plus delta t plus a quantity

209
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,170
in brackets times e to the minus r plus pt.

210
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,310
And pi of 1, t is 1 minus pi 0, t.

211
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,100
So in the limit, as t goes to infinity,

212
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,740
pi of 0, which is the probability

213
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,970
that the machine is down, is equal to p over r plus p.

214
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,930
And pi of 1, the probability that the machine is up,

215
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,940
is r over r plus p.

216
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,420
And again, that fraction r over r plus p is important.

217
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,420
The mean time to fail is 1 over p

218
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,026
and the mean time to repair is 1 over r.

219
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:27,640
Now, this is in natural time unit, it's not operation times.

220
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,550
Natural time units means minutes and seconds and hours

221
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,900
and so forth.

222
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,930
If the machine makes mu parts per time unit

223
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,420
on the average when it's operational,

224
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,940
the steady state average production rate

225
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:46,120
is just mu times r over r plus p, which is mu over mean time

226
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,750
to fail over mean time to fail plus mean time to repair, which

227
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,040
is mu e.

228
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,860
And e, which is r over r plus p, is

229
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,220
the efficiency of the machine.
