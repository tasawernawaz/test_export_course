00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150


1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,190
The notation to talk about Markov processes

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,270
with discrete states and discrete time is to say x of t

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,330
equals i is the event that the random quantity,

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,780
the random variable, x of t has value, i.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,800
For example, in the graph on slide seven, x of t

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,670
is any state in the graph and, i is some particular state.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,140
We're going to define pi i of t as the probability that x of t

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,660
equals i at time, t.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,740
And this is important and you see that notation a lot.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,590
The pi's have to satisfy the normalization equation, which

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,400
is the sum over all the pi's at time t equals 1.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,100
That is to say, x of t has to have

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,350
some of the possible values of i,

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,380
and the sum of the probabilities of all those possibilities

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,950
equals 1.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,740
So let's look at the transition equations.

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,330
How do we quantify the event that we go from one state

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,740
to another?

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,010
Here's a detail of the graph on slide seven

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,660
and I'm focusing on states five and four.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,750
To be in state four at time t plus 1,

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,500
the system must have been either in state five at time t

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,770
or in state four at time t.

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,550
So the probability of being in state four at time t plus 1

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,280
is equal to the probability that the system was in state five

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,610
at time t and made a transition from five to four,

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,800
plus the probability that the system was

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,500
in state four at time t and did not

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,870
make a transition to any of the other possible states

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,612
it could have gone to-- one, two, or six.

31
00:01:36,612 --> 00:01:38,070
And just to remember that notation,

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,330
P 4,5 here is probability x of t plus 1 equals 4 given x of t

33
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,779
equals 5, and so forth.

34
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:46,570
Here's another one.

35
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,630
Let's focus on state two.

36
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,080
The system could be in state two at time t plus 1

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,570
if it was in one or four or five or two at time t.

38
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,697
So the probability that it's in state two at time t plus 1

39
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,780
is equal to the probability that it's in state two

40
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,100
at time t plus 1, given that it was in state one at time t,

41
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,310
times the probability that it was in state one at time t;

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,060
plus the probability that it's in state two at time t plus 1,

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,750
given that it was in state two at time t times the probability

44
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,070
that it was in state two at time t, and so forth.

45
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,640
This looks a lot like that equation of total probability

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,230
that describe the probability that I

47
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,940
was going to have a cold tomorrow given

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,910
the weather conditions today that we talked about some time

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,390
earlier.

50
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,080
We've defined P ij as the probability

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,390
that the system is in state i at time

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,152
t plus 1 given that the system was in state j at time t.

53
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:45,610
To summarize what we've done before

54
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,240
and put it in compact notation, the transition equations

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,480
say pi i of t plus 1 is equal to the sum over j of P ij times pi

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,920
j at time t.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,130
This is an application of the law of total probability.

58
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,120
We also have the normalization equation:

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,230
sum over i of pi i of t equals 1.

60
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,340
So to go through this exercise with state two

61
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,740
from the definitions, we have the transition

62
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,640
equation for state two, which is pi 2 of t plus 1

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,220
equals P 2,1 pi 1 of t plus P 2,2 pi 2 of t plus P

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,730
2,4 pi 4 of t plus P 2,5 pi 5 of t.

65
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,900
And remember that P 2,2 is equal to 1 minus P 5,2.

66
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,820
So we're going to take the equations

67
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,410
that we wrote on slide 13 and now we're going to put them

68
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,840
in matrix vector form.

69
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,765
So pi of t will be the vector of the pi's at time t.

70
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:48,260
P is the matrix of the P ij's, and we're

71
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,250
defining a vector new which is a vector all of whose components

72
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,570
are one.

73
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,630
We can now write the transition equations as pi of t plus 1

74
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,140
equals P pi of t, and the normalization equation

75
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,380
is new transpose times by of t equals 1.

76
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,400
Other facts that we should know is that new transpose P

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,720
equals new transpose, which is a complicated way of saying

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,140
that each column of the p matrix sums to one.

79
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,750
The reason for that is the way we defined the diagonal entries

80
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:25,340
of the matrix P 1,1 is 1 minus the sum of P 2,1 up to P n,1.

81
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,940
We can also calculate pi at time t from pi at time 0

82
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,340
by iterated matrix multiplication.

83
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,900
So P to the t means matrix P by itself t times.

84
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,150
This is a graph of the probabilities

85
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,880
of all the states in the transition

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,500
graph in slide seven.

87
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,830
So now let's make an assumption that the non-zero transition

88
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,430
probabilities, other than the self loop probabilities,

89
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,301
are all very small on the order of 0.01.

90
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,800
That means that the average time between transitions

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,650
is on the order of about 100.

92
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,240
Suppose the system is in state one at time 0.

93
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,090
Then at time one, it's still most likely in state one

94
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,780
because the probability of transition is very small.

95
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,450
With small probabilities, it could be in stage two or three,

96
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,640
but it's impossible for it to be in any other state

97
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,360
because it needs more than one transition to get there.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,480
At times two, three, four, and a little while after that,

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,780
it's very unlikely that a transition will take place

100
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,510
so the system will still very likely be in state one.

101
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,510
After about time 30, as you can see on the graph,

102
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,760
the probability that the transition has taken place

103
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,530
already is not small, so the system

104
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,280
might be in state two or three as well as one, or even

105
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,720
others with small probability.

106
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,580
After about time 50, it's unlikely

107
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,110
that it has not left state one.

108
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,710
It might still be in two or three,

109
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,670
but it could have left them and moved on to five or seven.

110
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,410
Actually, it could be in any state,

111
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,450
but except for states one, two, and three,

112
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,680
the probabilities are still small.

113
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,660
After more time, the system could be found

114
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,610
in any state in the system.

115
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,160
The probability that the system is in any given state

116
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
depends on the transition probabilities,

117
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
the initial state, and how long the system has been running.

118
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,080
Now let's think about the system at around time 150.

119
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,680
We watch the system for a while and we observe the fraction

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,170
of time that the system is in any given state

121
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,419
and we observe that that fraction is not changing.

122
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,960
In fact, the fraction of time that the system is in any given

123
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,660
stated time 200 is about the same as at time 150.

124
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,850
In that case, we can say that the system has reached

125
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,790
steady state at time 150.

126
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,890
So formally, a system is in steady state

127
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,060
when it approaches a limiting probability distribution

128
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,590
as time goes to infinity.

129
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,500
And we'll call pi i the limit of pi i of t

130
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,280
as t goes to infinity, which is also

131
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:01,160
the limit as t goes to infinity of p to the t times pi i of 0.

132
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,350
But notice that now I'm saying if it exists,

133
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,990
so it might not exist.

134
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,670
Why would it not exist?

135
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,250
Let's go take a look at another example.

136
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,540
Remember the number of heads after t coin flips.

137
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,920
What we found is that the state will eventually

138
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,880
progress to larger and larger numbers over time.

139
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,710
There's no steady state in this one.

140
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,220
The probability that h of t equals 10, for example,

141
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,760
is 0 for t equals 0 one to nine, but it's

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,860
non-zero for t greater than or equal to 10.

143
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,690
As t increases, that probably first increases and then

144
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,550
decreases.

145
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,130
It approaches 0 as t goes to infinity,

146
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,070
but it is not zero for any finite t.

147
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,360
As a consequence, there is no steady state probability.

148
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,580
Some systems with an infinite number of states

149
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,430
do reach stead state, others do not.

150
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,960
This has practical importance as we're going to see later.

151
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,510
Remember that models are approximations of reality.

152
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,250
Everything in the real world is finite,

153
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,020
but sometimes infinite state models

154
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,950
can help us to understand some features of finite systems.

155
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,870
The steady state transition equations are just pi i of t

156
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,670
is the sum over j P ij pi j.

157
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,260
So this is the same as the non-steady state equations,

158
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,350
except that we've eliminated the t arguments.

159
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,610
So before we had pi i of t plus one on the left and pi j of t,

160
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,474
but now we just have pi vectors.

161
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:31,390
We're going to use the steady state transition

162
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,622
equations to calculate these probabilities,

163
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:35,080
but there's another way that we can

164
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,080
do things, which is the steady state balance equations.

165
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,600
I've written them formally here, but in the next couple

166
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,570
of slides I'll explain what it all really means.

167
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,540
We're going to also need the normalization equation in order

168
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,440
to define the steady state probability vector.

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,390
OK, we'll use state four to illustrate the balance

170
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,530
equations.

171
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,400
What the balance equations say is

172
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,090
that the probability at any time of crossing

173
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,750
that circle, the dotted line circle, from the outside

174
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,050
to the inside is equal to the probability of crossing

175
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,450
that circle from the inside to the outside.

176
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,330
This is only true in steady state.

177
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,300
There's no transition equation analog

178
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,580
of this when we are not in steady state.

179
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,410
So the probability of going from outside to inside

180
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,520
is the probability of being in states one, two, or six.

181
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,220
There's only one way of going from outside to inside,

182
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,860
and that is that we were in state five,

183
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,770
and then we make the transition from five to four.

184
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,070
So the probability of making the transition from five to four

185
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,920
is P 4,5 pi 5.

186
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
The probability at any time of going

187
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,380
from state four outside state four

188
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,920
is the sum of the probabilities of the states

189
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,040
where the system can reach from state four times

190
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,800
the probability of being in state four.

191
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,710
So that's just P 1,4 plus P 2,4 plus P 6,4 times pi 4.

192
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,300
So here's what I said before.

193
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,390
Intuitively, it means that the average number of transitions

194
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,760
into the circle per unit time equals

195
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,230
the average number of transitions

196
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,620
out of a circle per unit time.

197
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,335
The reason for all this fuss about probability transitions

198
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,812
and Markov chains and so forth is

199
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,520
that we're going to need that probability

200
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,580
distribution to evaluate the performance of certain systems.

201
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,120
So we need to calculate the steady state probability

202
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,630
distribution pi.

203
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,490
So how do we do that?

204
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, let's start off by assuming that the system has

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,640
n states and n is finite.

206
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,070
We assume there's a unique steady state probability

207
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,530
distribution.

208
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,040
The transition equations form a set of n linear equations

209
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,800
and unknowns.

210
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,390
The normalization is also a linear equation.

211
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,280
So that means we have n plus one equations and n unknowns.

212
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,490
Is that a problem?

213
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,790
We're not supposed to have n plus one equations and n

214
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,030
unknowns.

215
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,780
Well, it turns out there is not a problem.

216
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,230
One of those transition equations is redundant

217
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,590
and that's because each column sums to one.

218
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,410
We can throw out any one of those transition equations

219
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,470
and replace it by the normalization equation.

220
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,500
And then we solve that resulting system of linear equations

221
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,470
and unknowns.

222
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,650
We can solve it by hand if it's a small enough system

223
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,890
or we can use various computer programs that will help us

224
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,870
if it's larger than that.

225
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,420
A system that has a unique steady state probability

226
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,940
distribution is called ergotic.

227
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,910
The probability distribution as a function of time

228
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,880
approaches that limit, no matter what the initial probability

229
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,280
distribution was.

230
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,890
For systems that have more than one steady state solution,

231
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,330
the limiting distribution depends

232
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,820
on the initial probability.

233
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,162
The balance equations can be used

234
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,870
to find the limiting distribution instead

235
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,850
of the transition equations.

236
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,920
As before, one equation has to be replaced

237
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,350
by the normalization equation.

238
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,520
Which to use?

239
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,100
The balance equation or the transition equation

240
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,730
is a matter of convenience and taste.

241
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,100
If a system has an infinite number of states,

242
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,260
and it has a steady state probability distribution,

243
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,470
there are two possibilities for finding it.

244
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,740
It might be possible to solve the equations analytically.

245
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,150
We're going to see an example of that.

246
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,990
Otherwise, we have to truncate the system.

247
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,890
That means solve a system with a large but finite number

248
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,035
of states.

249
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,410
If you understand the system, you

250
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,480
can get which are the highest probability states

251
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,790
and you keep those.

252
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,420
Throw out the rest.

253
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,050
Solving that will provide an approximate solution

254
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,570
to the steady state transition equations.
