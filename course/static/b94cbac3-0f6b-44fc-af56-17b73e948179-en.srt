00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,440
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,330
My name is Jack.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,610
I'm one of the TAs for Introduction

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,500
to Manufacturing Systems.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,700
In this video, which is the first recitation for 2.854.1x,

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,890
I will go through practice problem one in detail.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,760
OK, so here is practice problem one.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,100
So three white balls and three black balls

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,700
are distributed between urns A and B in such a way

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,790
that each urn contains exactly three balls.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,050
One ball is drawn at random and simultaneously from each urn.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,450
These two balls are then placed in the other urn.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,140
This action is repeated many times.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,890
We are interested in describing how

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,180
the number of black and white balls in each urn behaves.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,550
So part of this problem, we've provided you

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,980
with the transition diagram.

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,850
The first thing normally I do when I see a diagram like this

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,190
is to place this in a transition matrix.

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,020
So here it is.

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,230


22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,500
In that transition matrix, it's easier

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,300
to set up if you label the states.

24
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,990
So we have states 1, 2, 3, and 4.

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,720
So let's put the states down.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:25,690


27
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,380
And same thing going down this way.

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,380


29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,540
OK, so let's first begin with state 1.

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,140
So it looks like if you're in state 1,

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,430
the only state you can transition to is state 2.

32
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:53,250
So that means a transition from state 1 to state 1 is 0.

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,130
OK.

34
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,150
A transition from state 1 to state 2 is 1.

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,310
That's the transition rate.

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,642
From state 1 to state 3, that's 0.

37
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:08,030
And 0 to state 4.

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,840
OK.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,070
From state 2 to state 1, looks like the transition rate

40
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,650
is 1/9.

41
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,240
From state 2 to state 2 is 4/9.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,790
From state 2 to state 3 is 4/9.

43
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,220
That's right here.

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,290
From state 2 to state 4 is 0.

45
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:42,650
From state 3 to state 1, state 3 to state 1, that's 0.

46
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,510
State 3 to state 2, that's right here.

47
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,950
4/9.

48
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,860
State 3 to state 3 is 4/9.

49
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:02,825


50
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:06,910
And state 3 to state 4 is 1.

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,560
That's this one right here.

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,770
From state 4 to state 1, that is 0.

53
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:18,300


54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,040
From state 4 to state 2 is also 0.

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,560
So state 4 can only go to state 3.

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,460
And state 4 to state 4 is 0.

57
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,300
OK.

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,130
So what's important here is, notice

59
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,240
that the sum of each column, they all equal to 1.

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:46,120


61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,460
OK, so here is our transition matrix again.

62
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,900
So to solve for the steady-state probabilities,

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,740
we have to set up the steady-state transition

64
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,560
equations, essentially basically is

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:09,620
multiplying this matrix by a factor of pis, pi 3 and pi 4.

66
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,800


67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,079
So here is four equations and four unknowns.

68
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,810
But as you recall from the lecture,

69
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,970
we have to replace one of these equations

70
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,620
by the normalization equation, which is just pi 1 plus pi 2

71
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:33,200
plus pi 3 plus pi 4 equals 1.

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,430
So let's set up the equations.

73
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,602
So pi 1 is just equal to 1/9 pi 2.

74
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:45,800


75
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,970
Pi 2 equals pi 1 plus 4/9.

76
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,900
Pi 2 plus 4/9 pi 3.

77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:16,940
Pi 3 equals 4/9 pi 2 plus 4/9 pi 3 plus pi 4.

78
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,560


79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,720
And pi 4 is just 1/9 of pi 3.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,441


81
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,690
Now we're going to have to drop one of these equations

82
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,810
and add a normalization equation.

83
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,950
For this example here, I'm going to eliminate

84
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,320
the third equation.

85
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,900
So we're not going to use this one.

86
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,950


87
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,150
OK, so here, I rearrange the equations on the left.

88
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,020
Basically, we have our three transition equations

89
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,680
and our fourth normalization equation.

90
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,620
So we have a system of four equations and four unknowns.

91
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,920
Now let's simplify equation number two, the pi 2 equation.

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:28,840
So basically, pi 2 minus 4/9 pi 2 equals pi 1 plus 4/9 pi 3.

93
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:39,260
So 5/9 pi 2 equals pi 1 plus 4/9 pi 3.

94
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:48,160
But pi 1 is just 1/9 pi 2.

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:07:03,820
So really, 5/9 pi 2 equals 1/9 pi 2 plus 4/9 pi 3.

96
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:18,250
So 4/9 pi 2 equals 4/9 pi 3.

97
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,840


98
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,808
And what it really means is pi 2 just equals pi 3.

99
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:32,290


100
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:40,090
OK, so now we have pi 2 equals pi 3.

101
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:48,336
Our first equation is pi 1, which equals 1/9 pi 2.

102
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:52,140
And our-- let's go back.

103
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:59,050


104
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,120
Pi 4 equals 4/9--

105
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:20,770
1/9 pi 3, and pi 1 plus pi 2 plus pi 3 plus pi 4 equals 1.

106
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,460
So now we have a much more simplified system of equations.

107
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,820


108
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,990
So let's do some substitutions.

109
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:39,070
So I see that we have a pi 2 here, pi 2 here, pi 2 here.

110
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,659
Let's substitute.

111
00:08:40,659 --> 00:09:08,230
So 1/9 pi 2 plus pi 2 plus pi 2 plus pi 4 equals 1.

112
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,760


113
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:22,440
So 19/9 pi 2 plus pi 4 just equals 1.

114
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,640


115
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:43,821
Now, pi 4 is just 1/9 pi 3, which equals 1/9 pi 2.

116
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:46,090
So what do we have?

117
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:54,940
19/9 pi 2 plus 1/9 pi 2 just equals 1.

118
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,330
So 20/9 pi 2 equals 1.

119
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:11,070
So pi 2 equals 9/20, which is 0.045.

120
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:17,280
So now, since we know what pi 2 is, and pi 2 just equals pi 3,

121
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,750
so that equals 0.045.

122
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:39,160
Pi 1 equals 1/9 of pi 2, which just equals 0.045/9,

123
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,920
which is 0.005, I believe.

124
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,280
And same with pi 4.

125
00:10:50,280 --> 00:11:04,190
So pi 4 equals 1/9 pi 3, which is just the 0.045 divided

126
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:13,330
by 9, so 0.005.

127
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,830
So there you have it.

128
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,620
We have our solution.

129
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,990
Pi 1 equals 0.005.

130
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,650
Pi 2 equals 0.045.

131
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,810
Pi 3 equals 0.045.

132
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:38,940
And pi 4 equals 0.005.

133
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,770
And you can check here that the sum of the pis

134
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,895
is just equal to 1.

135
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:56,890


136
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,670
So this concludes our recitation video.

137
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,380
If anybody has any questions, feel

138
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,890
free to leave it in the discussion block below.

139
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,600
And I'll look forward to our next recitation video.

140
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
Thank you.

141
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,473
