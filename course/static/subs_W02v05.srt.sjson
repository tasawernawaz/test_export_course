    "Before we get into discussing continuous random variables,", 
    "I think there are some philosophical issues", 
    "that we want to talk about.", 
    "When do we use continuous and when do we", 
    "use discrete random variables?", 
    "The temptation is to say that when the system that we're", 
    "analyzing is discrete, we use discrete random variables,", 
    "and when it's continuous, we use continuous random variables.", 
    "However, we don't have to be ruled by that.", 
    "All models are only approximations of reality.", 
    "Mathematically, continuous and discrete random variables", 
    "are very different, and they're analyzed very differently.", 
    "However, quantitatively, some continuous models", 
    "are very close to some discrete models.", 
    "", 
    "As a consequence, there may be times", 
    "when we have a choice, because the purpose of modeling", 
    "is to make predictions, quantitative predictions,", 
    "about what's going to happen.", 
    "So which kind of model we use for any given system", 
    "can be a matter of convenience and not", 
    "dictated by the nature of the system in a very rigid way.", 
    "For example, if we're looking at a factory in which we're", 
    "making small metal parts, such as nuts and bolts and washers,", 
    "et cetera, things like that, then it", 
    "might be better to model this as a continuous flow", 
    "rather than a large number of discrete parts.", 
    "For example, instead of counting the parts,", 
    "we might simply weigh the number of parts that we have", 
    "or look at the volume of the number of the parts", 
    "that we've made.", 
    "Now continuous random variables have to be treated differently", 
    "because they can take on an infinite number of values,", 
    "whereas the discrete random variables", 
    "take on a finite or a discrete infinity number of values.", 
    "So to talk about that, we'd have to talk", 
    "about probability density.", 
    "The probability of a two-dimensional random variable", 
    "being in a small square is the probability density", 
    "times the area of the square.", 
    "The definition is similar in higher dimensional spaces,", 
    "where we talk about volumes.", 
    "In this figure, we've represented the high density", 
    "areas with dark colors and the low density areas", 
    "with light colors.", 
    "You might want to compare this with slide 14, which", 
    "is a similar figure involving discrete random variables.", 
    "Now what does this actually mean?", 
    "So let's make up a story about a blindfolded dart thrower.", 
    "He's throwing darts at that same rectangle", 
    "that we had on the previous slide.", 
    "But we don't know exactly where the darts are going to land.", 
    "In fact, we don't even know if they're", 
    "going to land on the rectangle, but let's assume that they do.", 
    "", 
    "Wherever each one lands is random, and for our purposes,", 
    "unpredictable.", 
    "But one thing that we do know is that if he", 
    "throws a lot of darts, then a large number of them", 
    "will end up in the darker areas and a smaller number will", 
    "end up in the lighter areas.", 
    "The probability that a dart lands in a little square", 
    "is equal to the probability density", 
    "where that square is times the area of that square.", 
    "So the probability density is higher in the upper left corner", 
    "and lower in the lower right corner.", 
    "Continuous random variables can be", 
    "defined in one, two, three or even infinite", 
    "dimensional spaces and in finite or infinite regions", 
    "of those spaces.", 
    "They can have probability measures", 
    "with the same dimensionality of the space or even", 
    "with the lower dimensionality of the space", 
    "or a mix of dimensions.", 
    "We'll give you examples of that soon.", 
    "", 
    "So now let's think about what happens", 
    "as an example in a set of make-believe tanks", 
    "with make-believe water flowing through them.", 
    "In this case, we have two tanks.", 
    "Water can flow into the first tank,", 
    "and then from the first tank into the second,", 
    "and then out of the second.", 
    "There's a valve at the entrance of the first tank,", 
    "another valve between the first tank and the second,", 
    "and finally, a third valve at the end of the line.", 
    "The analogy to manufacturing is that these valves represent", 
    "machines, which can fail or be operational,", 
    "and the tanks represent storage or inventory", 
    "between these machines.", 
    "Here's the system starting empty.", 
    "There's no water in any of the tanks,", 
    "and the valves are all open.", 
    "If the valves stay open for a while,", 
    "we still basically have no water in each of the tanks.", 
    "In fact, there'll be a little bit of splashing.", 
    "But let's not worry about that.", 
    "So let's watch what happens.", 
    "First of all, notice that the third valve is closed.", 
    "And as a consequence of that, the second tank", 
    "is starting to accumulate water.", 
    "The first tank stays empty, because as soon as water", 
    "goes in, it goes right out.", 
    "So let's watch what happens.", 
    "Notice that the tank is starting to fill up.", 
    "The second tank is starting to fill up.", 
    "Eventually, we can see that the second tank actually gets full.", 
    "And when that happens, the water has no place", 
    "to go after the first tank.", 
    "So the first tank level starts going up.", 
    "", 
    "Now notice what happens.", 
    "The middle valve has closed.", 
    "Now with the middle valve is closed,", 
    "the second tank stays full.", 
    "The first tank continues to increase.", 
    "", 
    "So now we have the first valve open", 
    "and the next two valves closed.", 
    "Now notice that the third valve has opened.", 
    "The first tank is continuing to accumulate water,", 
    "but the second tank is starting to lose its water.", 
    "There's no flow between the first tank and the second tank", 
    "because that second valve is full.", 
    "", 
    "Now the second valve opens up.", 
    "Now all three valves are open, and both tanks", 
    "stay at the same level.", 
    "", 
    "Uh-oh.", 
    "Looks like the first valve closed.", 
    "Now no water gets into the first tank.", 
    "But water can still flow from the first tank", 
    "to the second one.", 
    "So the level of the first tank is going down,", 
    "whereas the level of the second tank stays constant.", 
    "", 
    "The valves are still staying open.", 
    "But now notice that the first tank has completely", 
    "emptied out.", 
    "Now there's no water entering the second tank.", 
    "Water is leaving it.", 
    "So as a result, the level of the second tank goes down.", 
    "And finally, the second tank becomes empty.", 
    "OK.", 
    "This graph represents the space of the water tanks,", 
    "which we're labeling with Bs now,", 
    "which represent buffers, which represent", 
    "storage areas in the factory.", 
    "Now the arrows in this graph represents how the water", 
    "can flow in the two tanks.", 
    "For example, when the first valve is open", 
    "and the last two valves are closed,", 
    "we're symbolizing that as one, zero, zero.", 
    "That means the first thing is open-- that's a one--", 
    "and the other two are closed-- those are zeros.", 
    "What happens then is that the first tank starts filling up,", 
    "but the second tank stays at the same level.", 
    "And for that reason, the arrow is moving to the right.", 
    "Another condition would be that the first two valves are open", 
    "and the last valve is closed.", 
    "In that case, the water in the first tank stays constant,", 
    "but the second tank starts going up until it becomes full.", 
    "When the second tank becomes full,",
