1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,930
The first week of this course is devoted

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,350
to an overview of manufacturing systems, what they are

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,630
and what problems faced designers and operators

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,667
of these systems.

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,250
We'll start off with a case that shows

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,436
the benefits of the methods we will describe.

7
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:16,810
We'll go through some definitions

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,970
and take a very basic look at the relationship

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,900
between a single manufacturing operation and the system

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,890
it is part of.

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,350
We will establish one of the basic themes of this course,

12
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,650
the effects of variability.

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,660
We'll describe some system architectures.

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,950
And we'll discuss some important performance measures.
