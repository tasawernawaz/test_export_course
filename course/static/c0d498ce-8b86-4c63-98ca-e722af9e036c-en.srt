00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome back to 2.854.1x.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,070
In this video, we'll go over week 4, practice problem 2.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,010


4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,510
OK.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,430
So here's the problem.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,465
Basically, it's about Jane who moonlights in the food court.

7
00:00:20,465 --> 00:00:24,350


8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,750
I guess she's a servicer in the food court.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,200
And customers arrive at her counter

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,180
at a rate of 10 per hour while it takes her, on average,

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,740
four minutes to serve a customer.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,490
So the arrival process is a plus on the arrival process

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,270
and the service time is exponentially distributed.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,080
So in part one, we are asked what type of queue is this.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,080
So since there is no mention of how long the line can be,

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,940
we assume it's infinite.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,520
And since there is only one server

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,470
and we're told of a Poisson arrival

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,440
time and exponential service rate,

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,055
then the model is an [? MM1 ?] system.

21
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:13,320


22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,620
Now what is lambda?

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,740
Well, lambda is given.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,160
So basically at a rate of 10 per hour,

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:29,060
lambda is 10 customers per hour.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,140
So what is mu, the service rate?

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,500
So if she serves four--

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,840
it takes her four minutes per customer,

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:50,020
then that is basically 0.066 hour per customer.

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,490
So we take the inverse.

31
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:58,230
That is 15 customers per hour.

32
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,990
And that is our mu.

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,750


34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,510
OK.

35
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,270
So here's part 2.

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,720
What percentage of the time is she serving customers?

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,970
So this is basically just the utilization rate.

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,750
Rho is simply just lambda over mu.

39
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:28,560
So that is 10 over 15, which is 0.66.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,130
So 66% of the time, she is expected to be busy.

41
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,460
So what percentage of time she is idle?

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,450
That's simple, right?

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,080
That's basically the percentage of time

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,470
when there are no customers in the line or in the service.

45
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:52,990
That's just 1 minus rho and that is 0.33.

46
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,780
What is the queue length?

47
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,170
So we had some confusion in this part.

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,320
A lot of students thought the queue length

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,870
is the same thing as the number of people in the system.

50
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,800
It's different.

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,230
It's basically the number of people waiting.

52
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,380
So it does not include the person being served.

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,400
So if we think back, L, which is the number

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,930
of people in the system, is just rho over 1 minus rho.

55
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,550
So what is this?

56
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,934
That's 0.666 over 0.33.

57
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:27,520
That's just two, right?

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,670
So on average there are two people in the system.

59
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,698
But what is Lq?

60
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:38,810
Lq is the number of people waiting in line.

61
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,390
So if the system--

62
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,070
if 66% of the time the system is busy, 33% of the time

63
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,570
there are nobody in the system, than the expected line

64
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:59,710
is just 2 times 0.66 plus 0 times 0.33, which is 1.33.

65
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,080
And that is basically the formula for Lq.

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,967
Lq is just rho squared over 1 minus rho.

67
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:08,800
It's the same thing.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,830
We basically dropped this part, because 0 times anything

69
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,736
is just 0.

70
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:18,700


71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,151
What is the average time that a customer takes in the system?

72
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:23,650
OK.

73
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,440
Well, we use Little's Law here.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,290
Average time in the system is w, which

75
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,201
this equals L over lambda.

76
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:33,700
Right.

77
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:42,020
In the last section, we said L equals 2, so it's 2 over 10,

78
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,000
which is one fifth.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
[? Hour ?] that is the--

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,755
and that is just 12 minutes.

81
00:04:49,755 --> 00:05:00,730


82
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,050
So what is the probability that the customer waits at least

83
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,280
four minutes in the system?

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,780
OK.

85
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,770
So service time is four minutes per customer.

86
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,520
Right?

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,380
So that means if there's one person in the line,

88
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,130
the second person has to wait at least four minutes.

89
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,430
So this probability is really just the probability of n

90
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,420
is greater than or equal to 2.

91
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,250
There are two or more people in the system,

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,310
then somebody has to wait at least four minutes.

93
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:45,770
And that is just 1 minus the probability of n equals zero

94
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,990
and minus the probability of n equal 1.

95
00:05:51,990 --> 00:06:00,010
So in our notation, that's just 1 minus pi is 0, minus pi 1.

96
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,110
OK.

97
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,050
The probability when there are nobody in the--

98
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,200
of when there's no one in the system,

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,440
we said in one of the earlier parts

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,370
that is just one minus rho.

101
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,900
Now if we go back to the lecture,

102
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,530
the probability of when there is only one person in the system

103
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,700
is actually quite simple.

104
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,410
And in the lecture notes, we say that it

105
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,880
is one minus rho times rho.

106
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,830


107
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,887
This is rho.

108
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,510


109
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,010
So if you plug everything in, the probability

110
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,470
of m greater than or equal to 2 is just 4 over 9.

111
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,240


112
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,130
OK.

113
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:59,840
So when Jamie is not busy, she is grading papers.

114
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,531
So how many papers can she grade while working

115
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:03,280
in the food court?

116
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,510
So when she does grade papers, it

117
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:12,150
takes her about five minutes for each assignment.

118
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,190
So mu is just one third.

119
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,160
This is when she is not busy.

120
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,490


121
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:35,040
Proportion of when she is not busy times

122
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,440
how long it takes her to grade a paper, which is 60 over 5.

123
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:52,870
So that means she could do four papers per hour.

124
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,670
That wraps up this problem.

125
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,010
Like always, if you have any questions or comments,

126
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,800
please leave it in the discussion section below.

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,520
Thank you.

128
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,392
