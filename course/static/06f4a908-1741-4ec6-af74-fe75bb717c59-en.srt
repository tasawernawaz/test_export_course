00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,534


1
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:03,950
Now, we're going to begin to study

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,750
systems that operate in continuous,

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,650
rather than discrete time.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,240
The states are still discrete, so they can be numbered 0, 1,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,910
2, 3, and so forth.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,490
Or with multiple indices.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,500
The time, however, is a real number,

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,020
defined on the real number line from minus infinity

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,770
to plus infinite, or a subset of that-- a smaller interval.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,230
There are important differences from discrete time systems.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,231
Since events can take place at any time,

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,689
we have to consider the probability

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,180
that an event can take place during an interval

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,860
rather than in a specific time.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,350
We do this for very small intervals

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,202
so the probability is very small.

17
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:43,910
This is a little like a density function,

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,830
where the probability of an event happening

19
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,110
in a small interval is proportional to the size

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,030
of that interval.

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,670
As a consequence, the important transition parameters

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,500
are not probabilities.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,510
They're rates in units of probability per time.

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,580
The probability of a transition from j

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,600
to i during the interval t to t plus delta t

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,860
is approximately lambda i j delta t,

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,840
where delta t is small.

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,450
Lambda i j delta t is approximately the probability

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,030
of finding the system in state i at time t

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,680
plus delta t, given that it was in state j at time t.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,000
And this is true for i not equal to j.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,660
We'll deal with i equals j later.

33
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,500
Let's rewrite that last equation to make

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,000
it a little more precise.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,470
Lambda i j delta t is equal to p of x of t

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,660
plus delta t equals i given x of t

37
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,250
equals j, plus little o of delta t, for i not equal to j.

38
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,860
Little o is a function that satisfies this limit.

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,030
The limit of little o of delta t divided by delta t is 0.

40
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,860
So in other words, little o of delta t

41
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,470
is a function which could be quadratic in delta t

42
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,870
or a higher power.

43
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,750
This is the formal definition of little o of delta t.

44
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,210
This is a standard mathematical expression.

45
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,490
There is also a big O function, which is related

46
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,230
but not the same thing.

47
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,390
If the size of the interval was not small,

48
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,560
the transition probability from j to i

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,950
would be a complicated nonlinear function of delta t.

50
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,290
That function would be 0.

51
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,400
That function would be 0 for delta t equals 0.

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,820
If we expanded that function into a Taylor series,

53
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,800
the constant term would then be 0,

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
and the first non-zero term would be the one

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
that's linear in delta t.

56
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,600
This is the transition graph for a continuous time system.

57
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,940
Compared with the discrete time graph,

58
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,370
there are two important differences.

59
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,010
Lambda is a probability rate.

60
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,580
Lambda i j delta t is a probability.

61
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,460
The labels on the graphs are probability rates, not

62
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,350
probabilities.

63
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,540
The labels on the transition arrows

64
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,510
are probability rates, not probabilities.

65
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,660
And there are no self-loops in the system.

66
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,540
We'll discuss why there are no self-loops soon.

67
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,940
Before we get there, think about what

68
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,490
the labels on the self-loops would be

69
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,230
and what they would mean.

70
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,100
So here's a hint.

71
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,160
We haven't defined lambda i i.

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,240
We've only defined lambda i j for j not equal to i.

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,090
Compare this graph with a similar discrete time graph

74
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,690
that we talked about earlier.

75
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,690
On this slide, we'll be developing one

76
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,700
of the transition equations.

77
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,830
Take a look at the graph on the previous slide

78
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,710
while we're doing this development.

79
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,350
In the example, we're going to focus on state 5.

80
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,920
So for delta t small, we're going

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,240
to look at pi 5 of t plus delta t.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,330
That is approximately this equation.

83
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,380
So let's focus on the first term in the right-hand side

84
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,610
of this equation.

85
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,730
If the system is in state 5 of time t,

86
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,370
when the system is in state 5, its next state

87
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,560
could be 2, 4, or 6.

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,650
Or it could simply stay in state 5.

89
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,230
Given that the system is in state 5 of time t,

90
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,760
the probability that the system is

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,820
in state 5 of time t plus delta t

92
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,240
is the probability that the system does not leave state 5.

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,019
That is, that it does not go to states to 2, 4, or 6.

94
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,320
That probability is the coefficient of pi 5

95
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,540
in the second line of the equation.

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,220
The second line is then the probability

97
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,010
that the system does not leave state 5 during the time

98
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,620
interval from t to t plus delta t.

99
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,890
For the third line, we'll notice that the transition

100
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,660
graph shows that the possible previous states from state 5--

101
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,850
the states from which the system can reach 5 directly--

102
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,310
are 2, 3, 6, and 7.

103
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,130
The probability that the system is in state 5 of time t

104
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,380
plus delta t, given that it was in state 2 at time t,

105
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,630
is lambda 5, 2 times delta t.

106
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,330
The first term in the last line of the equation

107
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,880
is the part of the probability that the system

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,170
is in state 5 of time t plus delta t, that is due to state 2

109
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,940
being the possible previous state.

110
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,780
Similarly for the other terms.

111
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,800
Then the whole last line is the probability

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,370
that the system arrives at state 5 from a different state

113
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,720
previous time.

114
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,910
So this slide is the next step in the development

115
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,035
of the transition equation.

116
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,820
It's equivalent to the second.

117
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,170
We simply separated out pi 5 from the rest

118
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,490
of the second line.

119
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,470
Now we'll subtract pi 5 from both sides of the last equation

120
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,810
and divide both sides by delta t.

121
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,110
In addition, we're going to take the limit as delta t goes to 0.

122
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,420
So this gives us the time derivative of pi 5

123
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,250
on the left side of the equation.

124
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,010
This is the transition equation for state 5.

125
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,510
It would be nice, however, to write

126
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,110
this equation a little more compactly and symmetrically.

127
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,720
To do this, recall that we did not define

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
lambda i j when i equals j.

129
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,600
So we have some symbols available for a definition

130
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
of lambda i i.

131
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,270
To do this, recall that we did not define lambda i j when

132
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,620
i equals j, so we have some symbols

133
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,830
available for a definition, lambda i i.

134
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,600
So why not define lambda 55 as the coefficient of pi 5

135
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,810
in this equation.

136
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,510
So that's what we're doing on this slide.

137
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,900
Notice that I'm saying for convenience.

138
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,020
I did that because this sometimes confuses people.

139
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,630
Since lambda 55 is negative, they

140
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,790
think that we've defined the negative probability,

141
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,860
or a negative probability rate.

142
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,760
We have not.

143
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,130
We have just used an otherwise unused symbol

144
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,910
to make the equation look a little bit nicer.

145
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,370
So now the equation looks like this.

146
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,370
So let's write this in general.

147
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,610
Pi i of t is the probability that x sub t is equal to i.

148
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,415
It's convenient, as we said, to define lambda i

149
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,010
i as minus the sum of lambda j i, where j is not equal to i.

150
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,770
So now the transition equations become

151
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:06,770
d pi i d t equals the sum of lambda i j pi j of t.

152
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,030
We also have the normalization equation.

153
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,660
The sum of pi i of t is equal to 1.

154
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,140
And just to remind you, that lambda i i is often confusing,

155
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,610
so don't let it throw you.

156
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,650
So let's look at the same equations in vector matrix

157
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,330
form.

158
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,780
So we're going to find pi of t and nu,

159
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,115
as we did earlier for the discrete time case.

160
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:29,120


161
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,427
Define the lambda matrix--

162
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:32,260
that symbol, if you're not familiar with it,

163
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,420
is a capital lambda, is the matrix of lambdas.

164
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,410
The transition equations can be written very compactly as d pi

165
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,310
d t equals lambda pi of t.

166
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,420
The normalization equation is new transpose pi equals 1.

167
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,700
That is, the sum of the pi's equals 1.

168
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,520
And we have some other facts.

169
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,610
New transpose p is equal to 0.

170
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,520
That's important because each column of p sums to 0.

171
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,400
The reason that the columns sum to 0

172
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,100
is because of the way we define the diagonal terms.

173
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,770
The diagonal terms are just the negative

174
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,900
of the sum of all the other terms in the column.

175
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,060


176
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,230
Also, pi of t is e to the lambda t pi of 0.

177
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,072
That's a matrix exponential there that e to the lambda t--

178
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:25,280
if you're not familiar with it, don't worry about it.

179
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,970
We will solve any equations that we come up

180
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,799
with in the usual way, component wise.

181
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,710
Again, we need to worry about the steady state probability

182
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,340
distribution.

183
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,220
So pi i, without an argument, is defined as the limit

184
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,110
as t goes to infinity of pi i of t, if it exists.

185
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,070
And that same issue about whether it exists or not occurs

186
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,530
in the continuous time case.

187
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,650
The steady state transition equations

188
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,950
are obtained by just setting d pi d t equals 0.

189
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,960
So 0 is the sum over j of lambda i j pi j.

190
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,820
Again, we have an alternative form,

191
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,000
which is the steady state balance equations, which

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,920
are pi times the sum of lambda i i for all m not equal to i,

193
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,150
equals the sum over j of j not equal to i of lambda i j pi j.

194
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,000
And of course, we have the normalization equation.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,380
That still holds for the steady state equations.

196
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,850
And we're going to have the same issue in which we

197
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,220
have to throw out one of the transition equations

198
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,470
or one of the balance equations and replace it

199
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,420
with the normalization equation.

200
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,730
In matrix vector form, we define pi as the limit of pi of t,

201
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,530
if it exists.

202
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,240
The steady state transition equations

203
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,420
can just be written 0 equals lambda pi.

204
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,570
And the normalization equation is new transpose pi equals 1.

205
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,900
Here are some sources of confusion

206
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,690
in dealing with continuous time models,

207
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,280
if you haven't seen this before.

208
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,730
Never draw self-loops in continuous time Markov process

209
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,950
graphs.

210
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,620
Never write something like 1 minus lambda 14

211
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,740
minus lambda 24 minus lambda 64.

212
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,630
Write instead 1 minus, and then in parentheses, lambda 14,

213
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,320
plus lambda 24, plus lambda 64, times delta t.

214
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,740
Or just simply, minus the sum of lambda 12,

215
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,080
lambda 24, lambda 64.

216
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,750
The reason for that is that the lambdas

217
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,210
are rates, not pure numbers.

218
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,860
Whereas, 1 is a pure number.

219
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,770
So you can have an expression that mixes them both.

220
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,640
So remember, lambda i i, which is minus the sum of lambda j i,

221
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,280
where j is not equal to i is not a rate and not a probability.

222
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,956
It's only a convenient notation.

223
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:51,456
