00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940


1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,610
Complex systems can be hard to manage.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,189
And when a system is not well-understood,

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,830
rules for management proliferate.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,370
This is because rules are developed to regulate behavior.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,010
Behavior refers to how the system behaves

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,140
and how it reacts to events.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,020
Good rules promote desirable behavior.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,340
Bad rules promote bad behavior.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,310
But bad rules can lead to unexpected, undesirable

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,510
behavior.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,710
Why?

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,230
Because the system is not well-understood.

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,240
If you don't understand how a system works,

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,290
you won't design rules that lead to desirable behavior

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,460
and desirable performance.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,280
Once somebody sees that things aren't going so well,

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,790
they develop new rules to regulate the new behavior.

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,370
But these new rules won't be so good for the same reason.

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,410
You don't understand the system.

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,600
You see the bad behavior, and you develop still

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,950
more rules, and so forth.

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,770
Whenever you see a complicated system in which there

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,630
are large, large numbers of rules,

24
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,870
that may be a sign that the system is not well-understood,

25
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,510
and you have to go back to basics to really understand it.

26
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,440
Let's make up a story that gives an example of this.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,390
We have a factory.

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,420
The factory is doing jobs for more than one customer.

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,290
The management observes that many of the jobs are late,

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,360
so they need to do something about that.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,740
So they come up with a rule.

32
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,200
The rule is, do the latest jobs first.

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,140
Well, this makes sense that means

34
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,840
that jobs won't get to be too late,

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,120
or at least that's what the common sense says.

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,330
However, they observe undesirable behavior.

37
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,880
More and more jobs seem to be coming later and later,

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,380
so this is bad.

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,570
They need to do something about this.

40
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,220
So they come up with another rule.

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,040
Since there are many different customers,

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
and some customers are more important than others

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,050
because they have larger orders or other reasons,

44
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,960
the new rule is treat the highest per customers

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,510
as though their due dates are two weeks earlier than they

46
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,702
really are.

47
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:01,410
That makes sense.

48
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,080
At least the highest priority customers

49
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,900
will get the good treatment, and you

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,740
can make a profit from them.

51
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,729
However, what they observe is that the low priority customers

52
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,520
find other suppliers, but the factory is still

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,880
late with the ones that remain.

54
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,380
Why?

55
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,630
Well, because they don't understand how

56
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,300
their system is really working.

57
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,920
When a factory makes multiple part types

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,350
and those types differ, they have

59
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,560
to change the configuration of machines

60
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,710
from being able to process one kind of part

61
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,290
to being able to process a different kind of part.

62
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,240
Frequently, those setup times are significant.

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,570
So if those set up times are not considered,

64
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,800
then you'll waste a lot of time doing unproductive work, which

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,810
is changing setups, and therefore you'll

66
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,920
waste capacity.

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,370
Any rules that do not consider set up times in this factory

68
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,000
will have to perform poorly.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,720
Now, there are two ways of reducing the time that's

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,100
lost due to setups.

71
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,570
One is technological.

72
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,450
You can simply change the machines

73
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,150
so that the setup times are reduced.

74
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,300
Or there's operational solutions,

75
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,210
which is to have larger batches so that you have

76
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,360
to change setups less often and therefore lose

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,340
less time for setup change.

78
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,410
On top of that, they need a better process

79
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,690
for deciding what orders to accept

80
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,000
and when to promise delivery of those orders.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,190
They also need to understand their factory's capacity.

82
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,890
What's the maximum possible production

83
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,770
rate that the factory can operate at?

84
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,860
And how that production rate is related to the setups.

85
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,380
Here are some important definitions.

86
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,050
Manufacturing is the transformation of material

87
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,981
into something useful and portable.

88
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:42,920
A manufacturing system is a set of machines, transportation

89
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,380
elements, computers, storage buffers, people,

90
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,740
and other items that are used together for manufacturing.

91
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,450
We can call these items resources.

92
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,200


93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,960
Alternative terms are factory or production system

94
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,430
or fabrication facility.

95
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,280
The last one is particularly used for semiconductor

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,740
manufacturing.

97
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,500
Subsets of manufacturing systems,

98
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,720
which are themselves systems, are sometimes

99
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,790
called cells or work centers or workstations.

100
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,790
And we'll be using all of those terms relatively

101
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,170
interchangeably.

102
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,140
Managing factories has always been challenging,

103
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,630
but these days there are more issues that are coming up

104
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,190
that make things even harder.

105
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,760
For example, there are frequent new product introductions.

106
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,840
As a consequence, product lifetimes are very short,

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,860
and process lifetimes are therefore very short.

108
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,560
This leads to frequent building and rebuilding, or at least

109
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,720
reconfiguring, factories.

110
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,190
There's little time for improving

111
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,100
the factory after it's built. It has to be built right.

112
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,510
So what do we need in order to do that?

113
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,560
We need tools to predict the performance of proposed factory

114
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,370
designs.

115
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,640
We need tools for optimal factory design.

116
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,040
We need tools for optimal real-time management

117
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,540
and control of factories.

118
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,150
And most importantly, we need manufacturing systems,

119
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,670
engineering professionals who understand factories

120
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,070
as complex systems.

121
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,700
Some more definitions.

122
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,120
Design quality is the design of products that

123
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
give customers what they want.

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Examples are fuel economy in cars,

125
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,190
advanced electronics, attractive styling in cell phones.

126
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,460
Manufacturing quality is manufacturing products

127
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,460
to avoid giving customers what they don't want.

128
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,180
Examples of what they don't want are exploding airbags

129
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,500
or exploding batteries.

130
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,660
This course is about manufacturing, not

131
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,680
about product design.

132
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Quantity is how much is produced and when it's produced.

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,310
Quality is about how well it's produced.

134
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,010
In this course, we focus mostly on quantity.

135
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,220
Much of manufacturing is setting goals and then meeting them.

136
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,640
In quality, the goals have to do with tolerances.

137
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,090
In quantity, it means delivering a specified

138
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,700
amount at a specified time.

139
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,750
In general, variability is the enemy of manufacturing.

140
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,660
That applies to both quantity and quality.

141
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,850
Variability makes it harder to meet goals

142
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,950
and requires you to be more conservative about how

143
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,570
you set them.

144
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,720
There are two basic styles for how factories meet demand.

145
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,980
One of them is off the shelf or make to stock.

146
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,290
In that style, items are available when

147
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,660
a customer arrives.

148
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,180
It's appropriate for large volumes, limited production

149
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,850
variety, and cheap raw materials.

150
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,980
It's very much like a supermarket.

151
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,070
When you need to replenish your home supply of Frosted Flakes,

152
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,980
you go to the supermarket and you find the Frosted Flakes

153
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,180
on the shelves.

154
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,730
If they're not there, you go to a different supermarket

155
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,524
to get your Frosted Flakes.

156
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,940
With make to order, the production

157
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,910
is only started after the order arrives.

158
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,220
It's appropriate for custom products, products

159
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,770
in low volumes, and products that

160
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,960
have expensive raw materials.

161
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,550
It's very much like buying clothes

162
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,840
that have to be tailored.

163
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,300
But for both make to order and make to stock,

164
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,876
there are trade-offs in how you manage the factory.

165
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,510
For make to stock, you'd like to have large finished goods

166
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,320
inventories to prevent stockouts.

167
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,260
Stockouts occur when a customer shows up

168
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,044
and the product he wants is not there.

169
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:12,460
On the other hand, you'd like to have small finished goods

170
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,170
inventories to keep the costs low.

171
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,824
Inventory is expensive.

172
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,990
And we're going to spend a lot of time later talking

173
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,300
about the costs of inventories and how to keep them low.

174
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,890
Inventory is expensive because of the time difference

175
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,640
between when you have to lay out money to buy materials

176
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,890
and when later you get reimbursed and more

177
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,320
for when the goods are actually sold.

178
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,570
In addition, storage space costs money,

179
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,510
and material handling of storage costs money.

180
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,280
There's a potential loss of value

181
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,020
due to obsolescence or spoilage while an item is in inventory.

182
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,870
And there's also potential loss due to damage or theft

183
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,140
or even misplacement.

184
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,460
For make to order, you'd like to have as much production

185
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,350
capacity as possible.

186
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,130
That allows you to meet the demand quickly,

187
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,860
as soon as it arises.

188
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,980
You'd like to make early promises and reliable promises

189
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,370
for delivery.

190
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,880
On the other hand, you'd like to minimize the excess production

191
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,390
capacity to keep costs low, because production

192
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,540
capacity, which is machines and other capital equipment,

193
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,560
costs money.

194
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,200
Factory management has to deal with complexity.

195
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,320
Complexity occurs when collections of things

196
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,410
have properties that are not obvious functions

197
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,290
of the properties of the things that are collected.

198
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,510
We'll talk about how things interact in factories later.

199
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,809
Non-synchronism, especially random non-synchronism,

200
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,070
and its consequences.

201
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,070
Factories do not run like clockwork.

202
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,160
Ideally, as soon as machine one finishes

203
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,620
an operation on a product, it delivers

204
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,110
it right to machine two that's able to pick it up and start

205
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,400
right away.

206
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,470
In reality, that doesn't frequently

207
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,560
happen because of lots of variations and lots

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,130
of complexity in the system.
