    "It includes smoothing of total production quantity", 
    "and smoothing of each model's production quantity.", 
    "However, production must respond to variable demand.", 
    "If production is always done at a perfectly constant rate,", 
    "it will not be synchronized with varying demand.", 
    "Therefore, there must be some variation in production rate,", 
    "but that variation must be controlled.", 
    "Production rate due to internal factory events,", 
    "such as machine failures and other stoppages,", 
    "must be diminished as much as possible.", 
    "The just-in-time idea applied to sales", 
    "is supplying products in saleable quantities only.", 
    "That means that production must adapt promptly", 
    "to demand changes and doing this eliminates excess inventories", 
    "of finished goods.", 
    "Production rate variation due to internal factory events", 
    "must be diminished.", 
    "If demand increases, hire temporary workers,", 
    "add shifts, and so forth.",

    "Our system has a maximum production rate, its capacity.", 
    "When demand is less than that maximum, capacity is wasted.", 
    "Smoothing production can reduce the required maximum.", 
    "However, when demand is greater than capacity,", 
    "there will have to be inventory or lost sales.",

    "The additional engines are produced in overtime.", 
    "If the engine plant did not alter their work hours,",

    "and then the line flattens out because all the b's", 
    "have been produced.", 
    "Finally, the production of c starts at about hour 102,", 
    "and that continues until the end of the month.", 
    "These graphs are displaying the surplus as a function of time.", 
    "Time, as usual, is on the horizontal axis,", 
    "and surplus is on the vertical axis.", 
    "The surplus is the difference between cumulative production", 
    "and cumulative demand.", 
    "When surplus is negative, it's called backlog.", 
    "What's the consequence of having such surpluses in backlogs?", 
    "There are two cases to consider.", 
    "One case is where the customer, the next production stage,", 
    "operates the same way that this stage did,", 
    "and the two stages synchronize their production.", 
    "The downstream line would never be starved,", 
    "and there would be no inventory accumulation between them.", 
    "In that case, there would not be a problem.", 
    "But we intend to talk about constant demand,", 
    "and what I've just described is not constant demand.", 
    "So suppose the demand is constant.", 
    "That could happen in various ways.", 
    "There could be three customers, not one.", 
    "One customer only for a's, one only for b's, and one only", 
    "for c's, and they all have constant demand rates.", 
    "Or there could be a single customer,", 
    "but that customer needs to mix products and produce them", 
    "according to abc, abc, abc.", 
    "The third is that the product is going to the general market", 
    "where demand comes from many independent customers,", 
    "and the demand rate is constant for each.", 
    "In that case the b and c customers", 
    "would not be served for much of the month", 
    "without an accumulation of inventories.", 
    "So let's provide some inventories.", 
    "They're the same is the surplus graph, except we've", 
    "added enough inventory to b and c graph", 
    "so that the graph is never less than zero.", 
    "Now, we've produced large inventories", 
    "by doing things this way.", 
    "Let's contrast that with a situation", 
    "in which the items are produced abc, abc, abc,", 
    "and demand is constant.", 
    "So we're producing three parts every 180 minutes,", 
    "or one part an hour, on the average.", 
    "But to do that, we're making the assumption that the setup", 
    "change time is extremely small, essentially", 
    "that the machines are flexible.", 
    "As a result the surpluses and inventories are all small.", 
    "But this is only possible if the machines and the people", 
    "in this factory are flexible.", 
    "But now let's suppose that they're not so flexible,", 
    "and the setup change time from one part to another", 
    "is one hour.", 
    "In that case, making a batch of 56 a's", 
    "and then a batch of 56 b's and then 56 c's would", 
    "take 171 hours.", 
    "The 168 plus 3 for changeovers, assuming that the cycle", 
    "is going to repeat every month.", 
    "171 hours.", 
    "On the other hand, suppose we mix the parts making one a,", 
    "one b, and one c, and then repeating that.", 
    "In that case, it would take six hours", 
    "to make one set of three parts, and 56 times 6 and 336 hours", 
    "altogether to make 56 sets of three parts.", 
    "This is almost double the time for the three large batches.", 
    "In other words, this would cut the production rate", 
    "by about 50%.", 
    "In general, smaller batches lead to less inventory, but a lower", 
    "production rate for the same operation time and setup time.", 
    "A batch size of one is ideal, but it can only", 
    "happen if this technology is such that the change over time", 
    "is minimal, and there's enough capacity to meet the demand.", 
    "One more example.", 
    "A plant produces 10,000 Toyota Coronas in a month.", 
    "It produces 5,000 sedans, 2,500 hardtops, and 2,500 wagons.", 
    "So for example, one month is 28 hour shift.", 
    "Production is divided equally.", 
    "In every shift, we have to make 250 sedans, 125 hardtops,", 
    "and 125 wagons, for a total of 500 cars.", 
    "An eight hour shift is 480 minutes,", 
    "therefore the unit cycle time is 480 over 500,", 
    "or 0.96 minutes, which works out to be 57 and 1/2 seconds.", 
    "On the average, then, once sedan must be generated every one", 
    "minute and 55 seconds, one hardtop", 
    "must be generated every 3 minutes and 50 seconds,", 
    "and one wagon must be generated every 3 minutes and 50 seconds.", 
    "The possible sequences to do this", 
    "is a sedan, wagon, sedan, hardtop, sedan, wagon, sedan,", 
    "hardtop, and so forth.", 
    "And that is mixing of models.", 
    "As long as there's no setup cost,", 
    "the sequence like this is desirable", 
    "because minimizes inventory.", 
    "But machines and people must be flexible for this.", 
    "The next set of slides will start off", 
    "with a discussion of setup times."
