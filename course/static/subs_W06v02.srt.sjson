    "This is the first of two videos on Kanban.", 
    "Some people who are only superficially", 
    "aware of the Toyota production system", 
    "think that kanban is the Toyota production system.", 
    "It is a key part, but it's not the whole system.", 
    "Kanban is an information system for controlling production", 
    "quantity and timing.", 
    "It's important to recognize that material is not the only thing", 
    "that flows in a factory.", 
    "Information flows as well.", 
    "The flow of information is important", 
    "for the efficient operation of a factory.", 
    "The information conveyed by kanbans", 
    "is about when a process is completed in an operation", 
    "and about when a process needs material to work on.", 
    "Kanban means card.", 
    "It was originally implemented as an actual card,", 
    "but it can have other forms.", 
    "It could be represented by a container for material", 
    "or it could be a virtual card in a computer network.", 
    "A withdrawal kanban describes the quantity", 
    "that a subsequent process must withdraw.", 
    "A production-ordering kanban describes the quantity", 
    "that a preceding process must produce.", 
    "We'll describe these in more detail later", 
    "and will mention others kanbans as well.", 
    "Kanbans circulate within factories", 
    "as low-level shop floor control and between factories.", 
    "In other production control systems,", 
    "schedules are issued to all processes.", 
    "We discussed the difference between pull and push systems", 
    "in the previous video.", 
    "In push control systems, schedules", 
    "are issued to all processes.", 
    "But push systems cannot easily adapt to demand fluctuations,", 
    "disruptions, and so forth.", 
    "This leads to excessive inventory.", 
    "Inventory can actually reduce some", 
    "of the effects of randomness and variable, but it has a cost.", 
    "It's better to reduce the randomness", 
    "and variability themselves.", 
    "Kanban is a pull system.", 
    "When demand changes occur, it's enough to notify", 
    "the final assembly.", 
    "All proceeding stages learn about schedule changes", 
    "through the kanban system.", 
    "It's not necessary to issue updated detailed schedules", 
    "at each stage.", 
    "Each stage notifies its upstream neighbor,", 
    "Kanbans coordinate production without disruption propagation", 
    "caused by scheduling changes.", 
    "Kanbans allow systems to operate based", 
    "on local real-time information.", 
    "The number of kanbans at each stage", 
    "determines the maximum inventory at that stage.", 
    "They can be one card for each part", 
    "or one card for a batch of parts.", 
    "This slide is very similar to one presented", 
    "in the first week of this course,", 
    "but we've added something new-- kanbans.", 
    "Now, in order for the operation to take place,", 
    "there must be a kanban present as well as everything else.", 
    "There must also be a place to put", 
    "the kanban after the operation is completed.", 
    "But this will not be an issue for now", 
    "because we will assume that the kanban buffers are infinite.", 
    "Kanbans function as a part of the control", 
    "system that prevents operations from taking place.", 
    "Why would we ever want to prevent an operation", 
    "from taking place?", 
    "Kanbans reduce production rates in a controlled way,", 
    "and as a result, reduce inventory.", 
    "In the following discussion of kanban systems,", 
    "each square is going to represent", 
    "an individual machine, a multi-machine work", 
    "cell, or a subprocess consisting of several cells.", 
    "It could be an entire factory.", 
    "Flow into and out of the square need not", 
    "be the same as that of any other square at the same time.", 
    "The movement of kanbans can be more complex", 
    "than described here.", 
    "The kanbans are used to signal when production is needed.", 
    "They can also have other information", 
    "on them describing the part that they're associated with.", 
    "We will discuss one-card systems now and two-card kanban systems", 
    "in the next video.", 
    "In this video, we have these squares that I mentioned,", 
    "which will be used to represent machines where operations", 
    "are taking place.", 
    "Here's a buffer.", 
    "This big circle is the work-in-process buffer,", 
    "a WIP buffer.", 
    "This is the kanban buffer up here.", 
    "We refer to the machine on the left as the first machine", 
    "or the upstream machine of the line.", 
    "The machine on the right is the second or downstream machine.", 
    "First, let's consider the dynamics", 
    "of the upstream machine.", 
    "The upstream machine is able to do an operation when", 
    "its previous operation or downtime is completed,", 
    "when there's a kanban in the kanban buffer", 
    "and a part is available to work on.", 
    "After the operation, the kanban is attached to the part", 
    "and they move to the WIP buffer together.", 
    "The upstream cycle repeats.", 
    "The upstream machine performs an operation,", 
    "and then does an assembly-- the card to the part.", 
    "It could equally go in the other direction.", 
    "The part and the kanban go into the buffer together.", 
    "The operation does not happen if there's", 
    "no part arriving from outside or, for our purposes,", 
    "more importantly, if the kanban buffer is empty.", 
    "", 
    "Now, let's focus on the downstream machine.", 
    "When the previous operation or downtime", 
    "of the downstream machine is completed", 
    "and the machine is not blocked, the downstream machine", 
    "takes a part from the WIP buffer.", 
    "It removes the kanban and puts it in the kanban buffer.", 
    "It does the operation on the part and the part", 
    "is sent to its next production step,", 
    "and the downstream cycle repeats.", 
    "If the downstream buffer goes down,", 
    "it does not take any parts from the WIP buffer", 
    "and it does not add any kanbans to the kanban buffer", 
    "while it's down.", 
    "If the first machine remains operational,", 
    "it can continue to work.", 
    "It removes cards from the kanban buffer", 
    "and adds parts with kanbans attached to the WIP buffer.", 
    "The upstream machine can keep operating", 
    "until there are no more kanbans in the kanban buffer.", 
    "We have not considered the possibility", 
    "that the buffer could get full and block the first machine.", 
    "In fact, we have assumed that both the kanban", 
    "buffer and the WIP buffer are infinite.", 
    "The only thing that stops production, other than failures", 
    "and so forth, at the first machine", 
    "is the kanban buffer becoming empty.", 
    "When that happens, all the kanban cards", 
    "are attached to parts which are in the WIP buffer.", 
    "Suppose there are a total of n cards.", 
    "The buffer is then holding n parts, the most parts", 
    "it can ever hold if we operate the system the way", 
    "we've described.", 
    "So instead of having actual buffers,", 
    "this policy could be implemented by a finite buffer.", 
    "If we choose the buffer size to be n, the behavior of the line", 
    "would be the same as what we've described.", 
    "Many factories do this, some by painting areas on the shop", 
    "floor for WIP storage, others by reserving a specific amount", 
    "of shelf space.", 
    "When the painted area is full, the upstream machine", 
    "is blocked and has to wait.", 
    "Now, let's consider a long line consisting", 
    "of many machines and buffers connected in the same way.", 
    "If the last machine stops for a long enough time,", 
    "it can prevent the next to last from working.", 
    "If the stoppage lasts long enough,", 
    "the machine upstream of that can be", 
    "prevented from working in the same way, and so forth.", 
    "We can think of the last machine in the line", 
    "as representing demand.", 
    "If demand is reduced, we can treat it", 
    "as an intermediate stoppage of that machine.", 
    "In that case, if the last kanban buffer becomes empty,", 
    "it prevents the next to last machine from working and making", 
    "inventory that cannot be sold.", 
    "This propagates the intermittent stoppage upstream", 
    "and this prevents any stage from producing excess inventory.", 
    "The maximum amount of inventory that any machine could make", 
    "is limited by the number of kanbans that", 
    "are allocated to that stage.",
