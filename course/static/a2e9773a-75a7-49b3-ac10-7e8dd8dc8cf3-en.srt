1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,547
Since there's so much randomness in factories,

2
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:05,130
we're devoting this week to cover some

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,660
of the basics of probability.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,630
So let's start off with a trick question.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,450
Suppose I flip a coin 100 times and it comes up heads

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,309
each time.

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,350
What's the probability that it will come up heads

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,970
the next time?

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,845
Who thinks that the answer is one half, or 50% of the time?

10
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:24,720
On the other hand, who thinks that the answer

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,850
is almost certain?

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,170


13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,700
Another way of asking the question

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,190
is to ask how much you would be willing to bet

15
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,160
that the next flip will be heads.

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,190
Suppose I said that if you bet on heads and it came up heads,

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,140
I would give you $1.

18
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,120
If you said one half to the first question,

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,203
you would probably say that you would bet anything

20
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:47,200
less than $1.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,700
If you said that it was almost certain that it would come up

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,610
heads, you'd be willing to bet any amount, more or less

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,490
than $1, since you're almost certain to get that dollar back

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,780
no matter how much you bet.

25
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,782


26
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:01,740
Still, another way of talking about probability

27
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,185
is to ask, what betting odds would you demand?

28
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:07,210


29
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,640
So these were all trick questions

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,610
because I didn't explain the problem fully.

31
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,220
If your estimate was one half, then

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,580
you actually made the assumption that the coin was fair.

33
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,410
Since the outcome of each flip is

34
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,190
independent of the outcomes of previous flips,

35
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,200
the probability is one half.

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,510
You treated this question as a probability problem.

37
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,570


38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,430
If your estimate was 1, then you used

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,400
the data provided to determine the probability of heads,

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,770
the data being that we flipped the coin 100 times

41
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,630
and we got heads every time.

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,710
You treated this question as a statistics problem.

43
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,680
Probability and statistics are two different subjects.

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,810
Probability is a mathematical theory

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,790
that describes uncertainty.

46
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,710
It's the analysis of random systems

47
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,990
and the prediction of their behavior.

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,480
Statistics is a set of techniques for extracting

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,550
useful information from data.

50
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,200
These techniques are usually derived

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,210
using probability theory, but other techniques

52
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,400
have come up recently.

53
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,860
In this course, we make heavy use of probability and none

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,520
at all of statistics.

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,190
This is not because statistics is not

56
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,280
important for manufacturing systems, it's very important,

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,930
but our time is limited, and I think

58
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,250
it's better to focus on probability issues first.

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,880
But what do we mean by probability?

60
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,830
Specifically, suppose I perform an experiment

61
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,140
that has possible outcomes A, B, C, and so forth.

62
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,770
What do I mean when I say that the probability of outcome A

63
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,660
is P?

64
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,270
Well, there are two major interpretations-- the frequency

65
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,300
interpretation and the state of belief interpretation.

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,500
In the frequency interpretation, the probability of outcome A

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,900
is P means that if I perform the experiment many times,

68
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,650
the fraction of times that the outcome is A is close to P,

69
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,330
and the more I perform it, the closer the fraction is

70
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,890
to P. This interpret makes sense when you're considering

71
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,620
an event that could happen many times or is very refutable.

72
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,640


73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,030
In the state of belief interpretation,

74
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,550
I'm willing to base an action, such as placing a bet,

75
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,060
on an opinion.

76
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,970
For example, if I believe the coin is fair,

77
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,430
I'm willing to bet anything less than $1

78
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,050
on heads if I get $1 if the outcome is heads.

79
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,480
An example of the state of belief interpretation

80
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,460
is the choice of betting odds.

81
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,020
So the statement that the probability

82
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,775
that the outcome of an experiment is A

83
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:29,790
is P, if before the experiment is performed,

84
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,320
a risk neutral observer would be willing to bet

85
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,184
$1 against getting more than 1 minus P over P dollars.

86
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,900


87
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,330
The reason to choose that fraction

88
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,210
is based on making sure that the expected value of the bet

89
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,590
is positive.

90
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,840
We're going to discuss expected values later.

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,290


92
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,050
A better example would be to bet on the outcome of an election.

93
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,802
You can't repeat an election many times.

94
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:58,260
You decide whether you want to make

95
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,440
that bet on the outcome based on your opinion of the effects

96
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,390
of many influences.

97
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,760
Regardless which interpretation we follow,

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,880
we can formalize this with the axioms of probability.

99
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,800
Then we can use these axioms to carry out

100
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,900
calculations concerning the outcomes of complex systems.
