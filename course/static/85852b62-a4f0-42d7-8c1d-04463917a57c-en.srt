00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620


1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,550
Let's add some realism to the model we just discussed.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,470
We will consider two new issues.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,010
First, the factory orders were material,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,840
but it does not arrive until some time has

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
passed-- the lead time.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,626


7
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:18,000
If everything were deterministic,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,280
this would not be a problem.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,820
Just order a bit earlier than we would have, otherwise.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,850
But the second issue is that demand is random.

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,530
The problem is that the demand that

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,780
occurs between when the order is placed

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,360
and when the goods are delivered might be large enough

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,090
to cause a stock-out.

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,840
A stock-out of a make-to-stock product

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,600
occurs when a customer arrives and finds that none

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,960
of the product is available.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,980
There are other possible issues.

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,950
Lead time could be random, production quantity

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,241
could be random, and lots of other things could happen.

21
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,350
But we're not going to be discussing that.

22
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,800
This is a graph of the inventory and inventory

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,860
position versus time for a deterministic system.

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,320


25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,350
The horizontal axis is the time and days.

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,520
The vertical axis is the raw material inventory and units.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,170
The raw material inventory position

28
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,090
is defined as the inventory in the factory,

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,510
plus the inventory that has been ordered but not yet arrived.

30
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,160
In this graph, we ignore the time

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,537
from when the supplier gets the order and when it ships.

32
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,120
That is we assume that the material is

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,040
shipped immediately.

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,410
The graph ignores all randomness.

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,910
For that reason, the factory order's

36
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,250
just enough so that the factory can exactly

37
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,950
meet the total customer demand between the time

38
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,360
the order arrives and the next time the inventory goes to 0.

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,940
One way of dealing with these new issues

40
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,500
is called the QR Policy.

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,090
We assume a fixed ordering costs,

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,600
like in the EOQ problem, a random demand,

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,640
like in the news vendor problem.

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,740
But the inventory retains its value.

45
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,600
It's not scrapped.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,420
The inventory problem was really a one-day problem

47
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,640
that was repeated every day.

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
Now, we're dealing with one problem

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,080
that continues indefinitely over many lead times.

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,840
If there is raw material left just before the next shipment

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,350
arrives, that material can be used for future customers.

52
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,479
That makes this a true inventory problem.

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,680


54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,630
The product is a make-to-stock product.

55
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,300
There's no advanced ordering by customers.

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
The policy is when the inventory level

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,550
goes below R, order a quantity Q. The problem is

58
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,360
to find Q and R to minimize the ordering plus holding costs

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,570
while not losing too many sales to stock-out.

60
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,970
Here's a graph of inventory and inventory

61
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,220
position as a function of time.

62
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,160
This is a graph of inventory and inventory position

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,580
versus time under the conditions for the new problem.

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,980
The horizontal axis is time and days.

65
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,740
The vertical axis is raw material and units.

66
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,940
The red line is the actual inventory in the factory.

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,370
The blue line is the inventory position--

68
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,930
the material in the factory plus the material in transit.

69
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,560
Lines are not straight due to daily demand randomness.

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,240
The lead time is 50.

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,265
The demand has a very large daily variance.

72
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:11,020


73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,480
In this graph, R is equal to 150, and Q is 300.

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,310
That is when the inventory falls below 150, the factory

75
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,710
orders 300 from the supplier.

76
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,500
The time between orders is not fixed because it depends

77
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,720
on the demand, which is random.

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,200
The object in choosing R was to keep inventory non-negative.

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,880
But you can see that the policy failed

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,980
to do so between about day 125 until about day 140.

81
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,230
We need to determine Q and R. First,

82
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,366
we describe how to choose R. Let L be the number of days

83
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,990
between when the order is placed and when the shipment arrives.

84
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,402
The order lead time, L, is constant.

85
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:48,499
Let D be the total demand that arrives

86
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:51,040
between when an order is placed and when the shipment arrives

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,770
that sell days.

88
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,130
D is the random variable.

89
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,780
The order is placed when the inventory level goes below R.

90
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,580
The factory would like R to be greater

91
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,250
than the demand that arrives before the raw material

92
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,670
arrives.

93
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,850
But since the demand is random, the best we can do

94
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,770
is choose R, such that the probability that D is greater

95
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,830
than R is less than epsilon, where

96
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,270
epsilon is a small number.

97
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,060
The value of epsilon is a management decision.

98
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,660
Management has to decide how conservative they want to be.

99
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,300
If epsilon were small, it would be rare for a customer

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,470
to be disappointed.

101
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,600
But that would mean that R would be large.

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,940
That is there would be lots of inventory.

103
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,610
If management is not willing to carry a large inventory,

104
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,050
epsilon will have to be large.

105
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,730
And that means many customers will not

106
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,271
get what they want when they want it.

107
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,970


108
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,310
It's convenient to write the last equation in this form.

109
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,350
If L is large enough, the central limit theorem

110
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,340
says that D is approximately normal,

111
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,900
regardless of the distribution of the daily demand.

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,080
In that case, we assume that D is normal with mean u and stand

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,730
deviation sigma.

114
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,530
The probability distribution of the demand

115
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,720
is given by this formula where phi

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,540
is the standard normal probability distribution.

117
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,840
Then we choose R to satisfy this inequality.

118
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,450
The smallest value of R that satisfies this

119
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,620
is given by this last equation.

120
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,410
Recall that in the EOQ formulation,

121
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,420
lambda was the yearly demand.

122
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,040
Here mu is the mean demand for L days.

123
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,590
Therefore, mu is equal to L lambda over 365.

124
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,230
We might want to adjust that in leap years.

125
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,540
A graph of R star is a function of epsilon

126
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,421
with mu equals 1,000, and sigma equals

127
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:31,530
100 is on the next slide.

128
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,600
The horizontal axis is epsilon, the fraction

129
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,900
of customers and that management is willing to let be unhappy.

130
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,080
The vertical axis is R. R is the reorder point.

131
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,060
As soon as the inventory drops below R,

132
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,190
we order more raw materials.

133
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,860
The graph shows that R decreases with epsilon.

134
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,490
Now we describe how to choose Q. It's almost the same as

135
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,860
in the EOQ formulation.

136
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,420
The expected time between orders is T equals Q over lambda.

137
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,660
The expected number of days in a year is lambda over Q.

138
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,210
Therefore, the expected ordering cost in a year

139
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,210
is S lambda over Q.

140
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,490
Assume that the holding cost for material in transit

141
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,160
is the same as for inventory in the factory.

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,380
This is not actually an important assumption.

143
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,567
The average inventory position is R plus Q over 2.

144
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,150
And the average inventory holding cost

145
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,090
is h times R plus Q over 2.

146
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,110


147
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,600
Therefore, we choose Q to minimize

148
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
the approximate expected annual cost, which

149
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,020
is given by this equation.

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,670
But since R is constant for this purpose,

151
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,970
this is essentially the same as the EOQ problem

152
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,200
for determining Q, which is Q is equal to the square root

153
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,950
of 2s lambda over h.
