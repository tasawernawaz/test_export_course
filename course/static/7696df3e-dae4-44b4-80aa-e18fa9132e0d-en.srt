1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,540
This set of videos is a brief overview and summary

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,990
of some of the key elements of the Toyota Production System.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,550
The references for this set of videos

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,230
are Toyota Production System, a book by Yasuhiro Monden,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,840
and Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Production System

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,990
by Steven Spear and Kent Bowen, Harvard Business Review,

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,110
September, October 1999.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,680
There are very many books, articles,

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,370
and websites that describe the Toyota Production System.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,920
The Toyota Production System was developed by Toyota

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,960
after World War II.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,970
In the postwar period, the west--

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,270
especially the United States-- was relatively prosperous.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,070
It was important to US manufacturers

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,150
to satisfy high postwar demand.

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,780
The price of goods was not as important as the production

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,380
of large quantities at high production rates.

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,550
Japan was poor.

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,190
Cost minimization and efficiency were most important

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,220
to Japanese manufacturers.

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,740
Toyota Production System is low-tech, not dependent

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,010
on computers when they came available in the 1960s.

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,960
All required actions had to be easily understood and executed.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,480
The Toyota Production System has been highly influential

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,700
and widely imitated.

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,670
Many Japanese words have entered the manufacturing vocabulary

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,040
due to the Toyota Production System.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,050
Knowing my limitations, I will make no claim

29
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,722
to pronouncing any of them correctly.

30
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:25,430
The Toyota Production System is concerned

31
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,890
with all aspects of manufacturing business,

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,629
not just factory design and operation.

33
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,170
It deals with the people in the company-- both the ergonomics

34
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,070
and psychology.

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,140
It discusses how to implement its methods,

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,480
considers material handling, information handling,

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,150
improvement activities, its relationships with car dealers

38
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,320
and parts suppliers.

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,200
People spend years studying it.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,630
Many people make a nice living as consultants helping

41
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,610
companies to implement it.

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,160
We will only deal with a very small part of this.

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,720
The goal of these videos is to make

44
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,840
you aware of some of the most important aspects of it

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,140
and to focus on manufacturing systems' engineering issues,

46
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,150
but there's a lot more to it.

47
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,520
First, we'll discuss the goals of the Toyota Production

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,910
System.

49
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,120
The goal of a business is to make profits.

50
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,580
This would appear to be obvious, but people in factories

51
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,560
often lose sight of this.

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,050
One reason is that people focus on their local subset

53
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,460
of the factory.

54
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,230
People are given quantitative performance

55
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,140
goals which are intended to help them contribute to factory

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,750
performance, but such goals could actually

57
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,130
reduce performance if not chosen wisely and updated as needed.

58
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,250
Toyota's primary goal is cost reduction and the improvement

59
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,810
of productivity.

60
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,390
By cost, they mean cash outlay for the purpose

61
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,710
of making a profit.

62
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,790
Cost includes manufacturing costs,

63
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,260
sales cost, administrative cost, and capital cost.

64
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,290
So the first element is profit through cost reduction.

65
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,480
The second is elimination of waste.

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,660
Waste includes excessive production resources.

67
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,260
Excessive production resources includes excessive workforce

68
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,610
which increases cost through salaries.

69
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,000
It includes excessive facilities which

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,840
creates cost by depreciation and financing and many others.

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,350
The problem is to figure out what is excessive.

72
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,630
Another source of waste is overproduction.

73
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,790
That's continuing production when products are not

74
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,080
currently needed.

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,110
Toyota sees this as the worst kind of waste.

76
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,140
Excessive inventory, of course, comes from overproduction.

77
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,480
We've discussed this in previous videos.

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,090
Inventory, in addition to its other costs,

79
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,390
requires manpower to manage it, people to transport it,

80
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,780
clerks to keep track of it, and so forth.

81
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,600
Unnecessary capital investment is another source of waste.

82
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,180
It's not just the production equipment, but also

83
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,270
forklifts to move around unnecessary inventory,

84
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,480
areas to store unnecessary inventory, and so on.

85
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,760
Additional elements of the Toyota Production System

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,940
include quality control, which is to adapt production

87
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,680
to daily and monthly fluctuations

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,370
in quantity and variety, quality insurance, which is the effort

89
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,160
to ensure that each process supplies only good products

90
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,630
to the next process.

91
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,540
This is not just rejecting bad products by inspection

92
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,160
or reworking them.

93
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,700
It's improving production quality in the first place.

94
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,330
And respect for people--

95
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,760
recognition that people are what make the factory work

96
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,160
effectively and that if there's poor morale,

97
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,850
profits are reduced.

98
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,430
This is not just a slogan.

99
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,900
There's lots of detailed discussion

100
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,540
of this in the Toyota Production System.

101
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,370
People have to actively participate

102
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,550
in all concepts and goals of the Toyota Production System.

103
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,180
People's ideas and observations must be considered seriously.

104
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,820
People must be convinced and won over, not just

105
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,960
ordered to obey Toyota Production System rules.

106
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Some more elements of the Toyota Production System

107
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,220
include just in time, which means

108
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,070
to produce necessary units in the necessary quantities

109
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,470
at the necessary times.

110
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,420
This leads to minimal inventories.

111
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,180
Autonomation, or jidoka-- this is autonomous defects control.

112
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,410
This is never allowing defective items to enter and disrupt

113
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,720
subsequent processes.

114
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,500
Just in time and jidoka lead to continuous flow of production.

115
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,840
Flexible workforce means varying the number

116
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,240
of workers as demand changes.

117
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,370
Creative thinking includes capitalizing

118
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,870
on worker suggestions.

119
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,420
Let's talk a little bit now about just in time.

120
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,340
In the assembly of car subsystems

121
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,870
and in the final assembly of a car,

122
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,820
the parts and subassemblies arrive

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,600
just when they are needed.

124
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,450
This is the goal of just in time.

125
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,660
If parts arrive too early, we have inventory.

126
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,740
If they arrive too late, there's starvation and idleness.

127
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,070
Just in time is hard to enforce in many factories,

128
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,810
because people hate to appear idle

129
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,800
or to let machines be idle, so they produce inventory.

130
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,260
Inventories are therefore not needed.

131
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,330
In reality, there are inventories.

132
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,320
They have a role, but inventories must be minimized.

133
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,330
Just in time cannot be achieved by central planning.

134
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,000
In many organizations, detailed management and scheduling

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,950
is often done centrally, but this

136
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,340
makes it impossible to respond to events as they happen.

137
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,900
Central planning exists in Toyota Production System,

138
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,290
but it does not micromanage.

139
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,150
Analogies are never perfect, but lets try one.

140
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,820
The role of management is more like that

141
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,030
of a coach of a sports team than the conductor of an orchestra.

142
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,650
Both make sure that their players know

143
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,500
the goal of the organization and their parts in it,

144
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,120
but orchestra conductors generally

145
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,260
try to remove all random elements

146
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,590
while sports teams must accept that they occur

147
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,170
and try to minimize their bad effects.

148
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,000
Also, people in each process withdraw

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,170
from the previous process only what they need,

150
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,210
and people at each process produce

151
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,160
what is necessary to replenish what has

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
been taken by the next process.

153
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,792
The kanban system is how Toyota Production System

154
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,250
works toward this goal, which we'll

155
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,970
talk about in the next video.

156
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,450
A push system is one in which production and material

157
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,370
flow are based on anticipated demand.

158
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,290
Detailed schedules are calculated centrally

159
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,270
and sent to each production unit.

160
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,220
The reasoning behind this is that everything

161
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,630
will be coordinated.

162
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,970
However, as soon as one production unit deviates

163
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,490
from its schedule due to a disruption, all

164
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,100
those that send it material or receive material from it

165
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,380
must deviate from their schedules.

166
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,300
Consequently, the disruption propagates

167
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,640
throughout the production system.

168
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,399
The Toyota Production System is intended

169
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,940
to be a pull system in which there is

170
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,100
no detailed central planning.

171
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,560
Central planning determines high-level goals for a month

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,660
or a week for each production unit,

173
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,340
then each unit determines what it

174
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,280
needs from its upstream units on a daily or more frequent

175
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,540
schedule.

176
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,640
This limits the propagation of disruptions

177
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,650
and the amount of inventory.

178
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,780
The technique they use to make this happen

179
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,279
is kanban, to be discussed shortly.

180
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,820
This is a list of some of the systems

181
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,160
and methods of the Toyota Production System.

182
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,590
We'll be discussing some of them in this set of videos,

183
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,460
including kanban, production smoothing, reduction of setup

184
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,220
time, standardization of operations,

185
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,560
machine layout, visual control.

186
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,220
And there are many more that we won't be discussing.

187
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,080
Spear and Bowen observed Toyota, and they

188
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,690
summarized what they saw as the core of the Toyota Production

189
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,360
System.

190
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,160
In their DNA paper, they say, "we

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,440
found that, for outsiders, the key

192
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,140
is to understand that the Toyota Production System creates

193
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,130
a community of scientists."

194
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,800
I find it very interesting that they used the term "scientist."

195
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,600
They mean that each worker must understand

196
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,552
the system and his or her part of the factory

197
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,010
and that when things go wrong, they

198
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,250
must use the scientific method to determine what went wrong.

199
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,930
Then they correct it.

200
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,410
A function of managers is to guide and support this effort.

201
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,540
They observed that people obey four rules.

202
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,580
First, all work shall be highly specified

203
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,720
as to content, sequence, timing, and outcome.

204
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,140
Second, every customer supplier connection must be direct,

205
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,240
and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way

206
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,820
to send requests and receive responses.

207
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,220
Third, the pathway for every product and service

208
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,580
must be simple and direct.

209
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,140
These first three rules are intended

210
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,080
to eliminate all possible ambiguities, misunderstandings,

211
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,640
and miscommunications.

212
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,710
Any improvement must be made in accordance

213
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,660
with the scientific method under the guidance

214
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,550
of a teacher at the lowest possible level

215
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,824
of the organization.

216
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:59,240
They observed that there was a common vision in the Toyota

217
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,720
Production System.

218
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,840
The output of an ideal person, group of people,

219
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,230
or machine is defect-free, providing

220
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,530
features and performance the customer expects.

221
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,720
It can be delivered one request at a time--

222
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,665
in effect, a batch size of one.

223
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:17,190
It can be supplied on demand in the version requested.

224
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,940
It can be delivered immediately.

225
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,890
It can be produced without wasting any materials, labor,

226
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,930
energy or other resources such as costs

227
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,719
associated with inventory.

228
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,760
And it can be produced in a work environment that

229
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,980
is safe physically, emotionally, and professionally

230
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,630
for every employee.

231
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,340
This is the ideal.

232
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,830
You must always work to approach it.

233
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,920
Another common theme is the elimination of variability

234
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,906
and the reduction of sensitivity to variability.

235
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:44,406
