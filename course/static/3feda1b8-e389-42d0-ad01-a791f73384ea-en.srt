1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,350
In the set of slides, we examined several graphs

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,780
to look at the sensitivity of the optimal inventory

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,450
to the parameters of the news vendor problem.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,940
We have a set of base values for all the parameters.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,010
We vary the parameters one at a time

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,907
to see how x star changes with them.

7
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:20,240
There are two base cases and we'll switch back and forth

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,500
between them.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,764
In example one, the sale price of the papers is $1.

10
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,680
And the price the vendor pays to the publisher

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,170
is $0.25, for each paper.

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,150
The salvage price is zero.

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,860
The mean demand is 100.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,320
And the standard deviation demand

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,670
is 10 newspapers in a day.

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,070
An example to all the parameters are the same

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,180
except the price that the vendor pays to the publisher is $0.75.

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,390
We assume that the demand is distributed normally.

19
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,300
This assumption gets us into a little trouble in some cases,

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,710
as we will discuss shortly.

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,900
This kind of exercise is useful for at least three reasons.

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,740
First, we see if the behavior makes sense intuitively,

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,900
that is, if it seems reasonable.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,590
If it does, great.

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,590
If it doesn't, we have to examine both the model

26
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,750
and our intuition.

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,930
If we can't find any problems in the model of the analysis,

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,450
then we have to ask ourselves if our intuition is correct

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,510
and think hard about what the graphs tell us.

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,220
Second, we may not have any intuition

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,980
at all about the problem we are considering.

32
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,810
In that case, if the model seems correct

33
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,450
we can develop new intuition.

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,360
Third, it helps us to find limitations of the model

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,950
or of the analysis.

36
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,400
In this graph, the horizontal axis is the sale price r.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,460
And the vertical axis is the optimal purchase amount, x

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,750
star.

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,430
Other than r, all the parameters are

40
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,640
fixed that the values at the top of the slide.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,970
We see that x star increases monotonically in r.

42
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,820
This makes sense given the assumption of the problem.

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,650
The higher the sale price for the papers

44
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,690
the more the vendor should be willing to buy

45
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,250
from the publisher.

46
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,100
In fact, x star would continue to increase to infinity

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,010
as r increases to infinity.

48
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,550
However, this reveals some of the limitations of the problem

49
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,870
formulation.

50
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,170
The model has no mechanism for varying the demand

51
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,789
as a function of the sale price.

52
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,000
We assume that mu and sigma are fixed.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,240
Clearly if the price of the newspaper rose to $100,

54
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,980
sales would drop off.

55
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,830
The only way to allow the demand to be a function of the sale

56
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,990
price in a model like this would be

57
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,450
to make the mean and possibly the standard deviation

58
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,570
of the demand functions of the price, r.

59
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,120
But that would raise another question, exactly how does

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,030
the demand depend on the price?

61
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,800
That does not make the model useless.

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,080
Its behavior as a function of r is reasonable

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,700
given the assumptions.

64
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,010
This gives us some confidence that its behavior

65
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,040
as a function of other parameters is also reasonable.

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,770
Also, the demand probably changes

67
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,650
very little over a limited range of r.

68
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,430
In that case, the model would be accurate.

69
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,250
And marketers have tools for predicting demand changes

70
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,410
for small changes in price.

71
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,360
These tools could be incorporated in the model.

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,100
One more observation about this graph,

73
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,380
x star rises very steeply in the neighborhood of r equals $0.25.

74
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,620
This is because the sale price r, in this range,

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,120
is only slightly greater than the cost, c, which is $0.25.

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,240
For example, suppose the sale price were $0.26,

77
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,120
then the vendor would make one penny for each paper sold

78
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,780
and would lose $0.25 for each paper unsold.

79
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,380
That is, for every unsold paper on a bad day,

80
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,450
the vendor loses the profit made by selling

81
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,760
25 papers on a good day.

82
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,880
Consequently, there is great incentive to be cautious

83
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,070
and that keeps x star low.

84
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,900
As the sale price increases, the number

85
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,830
of papers sold on a good day for every paper unsold on a bad day

86
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,530
decreases rapidly at first and then more slowly

87
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,270
as r increases.

88
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,340
The vendor can be less cautious.

89
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,050
That is, when r is not to a much greater than c, x

90
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,880
star increases rapidly with r.

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,205
This graph is also x star versus r.

92
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,920
The only difference is that here, is that the publisher

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,770
price here is $0.75.

94
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,960
It looks like the same graph as the previous shifted

95
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,767
on the horizontal axis.

96
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,100
In this graph, we look at the effect of different values

97
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,410
of c on x star.

98
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,479
The horizontal axis is c.

99
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,660
r and all the other parameters are held constant.

100
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,970
c is the discounted price that the vendor pays

101
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,680
the publisher for the papers.

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
When c is very small, the vendor takes

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,790
on very little risk for each paper bought

104
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,140
from the publisher.

105
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,680
Consequently, the vendor is willing to buy a lot of papers.

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,880
As the price, c, goes to zero, x star goes to infinity.

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,070
On the other hand, when c approaches r,

108
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,070
there is very little profit in the sale of each paper

109
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,650
and a lot of loss for each paper not sold.

110
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,020
Consequently, there is little incentive for the vendor

111
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,180
to invest in very many papers.

112
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,900
As c goes to r, x star goes to zero.

113
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,160
This graph shows the effect of s, the salvage price on x star.

114
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,740
s equals zero in all the other cases but it's non-zero here.

115
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,930
x star increases with s, because larger s

116
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,910
means that there's less risk.

117
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,720
As s approaches c, the risk disappears.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,750
If s were equal to c, the price that the vendor pays

119
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,090
the publisher for newspapers, it would

120
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,810
mean that the vendor could do no worse than breaking even.

121
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,490
Consequently, as s approaches c, x star approaches infinity.

122
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,160
Here again, we have x star versus s.

123
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,430
In this case, c equals $0.75.

124
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,510
The graph is similar to the previous one.

125
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,250
In this graph, we vary mu and look at x star.

126
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,100
We will discuss shortly why this graph looks linear.

127
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,010
It is linear, but the graph is actually not quite right.

128
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,900
We'll discuss that as well.

129
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,330
See if you can figure out what the problem is, if you can,

130
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,960
before you look at slides 41 to 44,

131
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,300
which is where we discuss this.

132
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,030
It shows that the optimal amount to buy from the publisher

133
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,850
increases with the mean of the demand.

134
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,210
This makes sense.

135
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,390
The more papers people want to buy,

136
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,130
the more the vendor should provide.

137
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,820
This graph is very similar.

138
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,790
It's also x star versus mu.

139
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,190
This times c is $0.75 whereas c was

140
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,680
equal to $0.25 in the previous graph.

141
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,390
In this graph, we consider the effect

142
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,930
of the standard deviation of demand on x star.

143
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,110
Similarly, the graph is linear but really it shouldn't be.

144
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,360
And we'll explain why shortly.

145
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,670
In this graph, the publisher's price to the vendor

146
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,140
is $0.25 per paper.

147
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,270
This graph shows that as the standard deviation

148
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,940
of the demand increases, the more papers the vendor

149
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,990
should buy.

150
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,900
But before we develop an intuitive explanation of this,

151
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,490
we should look at the next graph.

152
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,550
Here we also have x star versus sigma.

153
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,250
Here we also have x star versus sigma.

154
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,710
The graph is also linear as it was in the previous

155
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,410
but it is not similar to the previous one,

156
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,130
Here, c equals $0.75.

157
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,860
This star suggests that x star decreases

158
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,320
with the standard deviation of demand.

159
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,140
Why is this different from the previous one?

160
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,100
To understand why x star is linear in mu and sigma,

161
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,330
lets recall what x star is.

162
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,870
It's the solution to this equation.

163
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,830
x star is the solution to this equation, the distribution

164
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,230
function evaluated x star is equal to r

165
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,050
minus c over r minus s.

166
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,460
Let's assume that the demand is normal, with means--

167
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,200
Let's assume that the demand is normally

168
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,250
distributed with parameters mu and sigma,

169
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,860
then for any demand, w, the distribution function

170
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,540
evaluated at w is simply the standard normal evaluated

171
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,220
at w minus mu over sigma.

172
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,730
Therefore the standard normal evaluated at x star minus mu

173
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,230
over sigma, is equal to r minus c over r minus s.

174
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,170
Or we can write it this way by just inverting

175
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,590
the standard normal.

176
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,920
And finally, this becomes x star equals

177
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,160
mu plus sigma times the inverse of

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,130
the standard normal evaluated at r minus c over r minus s.

179
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,450
So this explains why x star is linear in mu and sigma.

180
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:14,360


181
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,790
Should x star actually be linear in mu and sigma?

182
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,540
The answer is yes and no.

183
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,870
Yes if we accept the assumption that the demand is normal.

184
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,820
But no in reality, because the demand cannot be normal.

185
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,830
It cannot be normal because the demand cannot be negative.

186
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,370
In fact, the demand is more realistically modeled

187
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,289
as a truncated normal.

188
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,480
So then for what values of mu and sigma

189
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,410
is x star closest to linear in mu and sigma.

190
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,950
The answer is when mu is much greater than sigma.

191
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,930
If so, the normal distribution predicts

192
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,320
a very small probability for w being negative.

193
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,360
Therefore, the normal is a good approximation

194
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,177
for the truncated normal in that range.

195
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,010
Another question that arises from the graphs

196
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,550
is, what determines whether x star increases or decreases

197
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,810
in sigma.

198
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,800
To answer that, note that the standard normal--

199
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,350
note that the inverse of the standard normal

200
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,170
is positive if it's evaluated at a quantity which

201
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,140
is greater than 0.5.

202
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,610
And it's negative if it's evaluated at a quantity which

203
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,070
is less than 0.5.

204
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,730
Well, since x is equal to mu plus sigma

205
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,380
times the standard normal inverse of r

206
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,210
minus c over r minus s, then x star

207
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,810
must increase with sigma if r minus c over r minus s

208
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,780
is greater than 0.5, and decrease with sigma

209
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,590
if r minus c over r minus s is less than 0.5.

210
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,410
The next question is, can we extend this strategy

211
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,350
to manage inventory in other settings?

212
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,380
Specifically suppose the stock remaining at the end of the day

213
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,054
can be used in the future.

214
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,220
In other words, we don't have a news vendor problem,

215
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,270
we have a true inventory problem.

216
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,540
Because is the result that we found of the news vendor

217
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,930
problem suggests a possible heuristic extension.

218
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,840
Heuristic here means it seems like a pretty good idea

219
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,450
but we don't have a rigorous proof that it really is.

220
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,070
Well, the answer is yes.

221
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,250
Build enough inventory to satisfy demand

222
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,120
100K% of the time for some k, where

223
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,980
k is given by that fraction.

224
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,359
Compare this with a discussion on slide 28.

225
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:26,859
