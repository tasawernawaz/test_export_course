00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750


1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,879
Before we get into discussing continuous random variables,

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,670
I think there are some philosophical issues

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,610
that we want to talk about.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,040
When do we use continuous and when do we

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,920
use discrete random variables?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,950
The temptation is to say that when the system that we're

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,080
analyzing is discrete, we use discrete random variables,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,590
and when it's continuous, we use continuous random variables.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,490
However, we don't have to be ruled by that.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,170
All models are only approximations of reality.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,380
Mathematically, continuous and discrete random variables

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,980
are very different, and they're analyzed very differently.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,150
However, quantitatively, some continuous models

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,100
are very close to some discrete models.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,200


16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,840
As a consequence, there may be times

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,330
when we have a choice, because the purpose of modeling

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,910
is to make predictions, quantitative predictions,

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,860
about what's going to happen.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,590
So which kind of model we use for any given system

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,080
can be a matter of convenience and not

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,580
dictated by the nature of the system in a very rigid way.

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,320
For example, if we're looking at a factory in which we're

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,740
making small metal parts, such as nuts and bolts and washers,

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,290
et cetera, things like that, then it

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,140
might be better to model this as a continuous flow

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,050
rather than a large number of discrete parts.

28
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,410
For example, instead of counting the parts,

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,870
we might simply weigh the number of parts that we have

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,480
or look at the volume of the number of the parts

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,890
that we've made.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,690
Now continuous random variables have to be treated differently

33
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,579
because they can take on an infinite number of values,

34
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,120
whereas the discrete random variables

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,734
take on a finite or a discrete infinity number of values.

36
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,400
So to talk about that, we'd have to talk

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,410
about probability density.

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,840
The probability of a two-dimensional random variable

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,050
being in a small square is the probability density

40
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,840
times the area of the square.

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,330
The definition is similar in higher dimensional spaces,

42
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,760
where we talk about volumes.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,300
In this figure, we've represented the high density

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,410
areas with dark colors and the low density areas

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,090
with light colors.

46
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,880
You might want to compare this with slide 14, which

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,270
is a similar figure involving discrete random variables.

48
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,500
Now what does this actually mean?

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,430
So let's make up a story about a blindfolded dart thrower.

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,220
He's throwing darts at that same rectangle

51
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,860
that we had on the previous slide.

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,407
But we don't know exactly where the darts are going to land.

53
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:47,990
In fact, we don't even know if they're

54
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,573
going to land on the rectangle, but let's assume that they do.

55
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,950


56
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,960
Wherever each one lands is random, and for our purposes,

57
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,840
unpredictable.

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,290
But one thing that we do know is that if he

59
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,040
throws a lot of darts, then a large number of them

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,580
will end up in the darker areas and a smaller number will

61
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,070
end up in the lighter areas.

62
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,840
The probability that a dart lands in a little square

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,930
is equal to the probability density

64
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,770
where that square is times the area of that square.

65
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,800
So the probability density is higher in the upper left corner

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,920
and lower in the lower right corner.

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,960
Continuous random variables can be

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,240
defined in one, two, three or even infinite

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,660
dimensional spaces and in finite or infinite regions

70
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,240
of those spaces.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,710
They can have probability measures

72
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,010
with the same dimensionality of the space or even

73
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,990
with the lower dimensionality of the space

74
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,719
or a mix of dimensions.

75
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,260
We'll give you examples of that soon.

76
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,890


77
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,130
So now let's think about what happens

78
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,250
as an example in a set of make-believe tanks

79
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,610
with make-believe water flowing through them.

80
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,680
In this case, we have two tanks.

81
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,870
Water can flow into the first tank,

82
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,790
and then from the first tank into the second,

83
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,240
and then out of the second.

84
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,310
There's a valve at the entrance of the first tank,

85
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,370
another valve between the first tank and the second,

86
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,110
and finally, a third valve at the end of the line.

87
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,100
The analogy to manufacturing is that these valves represent

88
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,850
machines, which can fail or be operational,

89
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,850
and the tanks represent storage or inventory

90
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,320
between these machines.

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,560
Here's the system starting empty.

92
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,660
There's no water in any of the tanks,

93
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,360
and the valves are all open.

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
If the valves stay open for a while,

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,362
we still basically have no water in each of the tanks.

96
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,320
In fact, there'll be a little bit of splashing.

97
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,700
But let's not worry about that.

98
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,100
So let's watch what happens.

99
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,550
First of all, notice that the third valve is closed.

100
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,080
And as a consequence of that, the second tank

101
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,420
is starting to accumulate water.

102
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,210
The first tank stays empty, because as soon as water

103
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,220
goes in, it goes right out.

104
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,430
So let's watch what happens.

105
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,520
Notice that the tank is starting to fill up.

106
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,850
The second tank is starting to fill up.

107
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,660
Eventually, we can see that the second tank actually gets full.

108
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,420
And when that happens, the water has no place

109
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,140
to go after the first tank.

110
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,170
So the first tank level starts going up.

111
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,170


112
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,880
Now notice what happens.

113
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,410
The middle valve has closed.

114
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,470
Now with the middle valve is closed,

115
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,230
the second tank stays full.

116
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,285
The first tank continues to increase.

117
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,260


118
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,890
So now we have the first valve open

119
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,070
and the next two valves closed.

120
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,490
Now notice that the third valve has opened.

121
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,000
The first tank is continuing to accumulate water,

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,330
but the second tank is starting to lose its water.

123
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,850
There's no flow between the first tank and the second tank

124
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,530
because that second valve is full.

125
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,810


126
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,360
Now the second valve opens up.

127
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,890
Now all three valves are open, and both tanks

128
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,060
stay at the same level.

129
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,452


130
00:06:17,452 --> 00:06:18,750
Uh-oh.

131
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,900
Looks like the first valve closed.

132
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,990
Now no water gets into the first tank.

133
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,000
But water can still flow from the first tank

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,660
to the second one.

135
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,944
So the level of the first tank is going down,

136
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:34,110
whereas the level of the second tank stays constant.

137
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,740


138
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,550
The valves are still staying open.

139
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,790
But now notice that the first tank has completely

140
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,200
emptied out.

141
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,050
Now there's no water entering the second tank.

142
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,760
Water is leaving it.

143
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,790
So as a result, the level of the second tank goes down.

144
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,780
And finally, the second tank becomes empty.

145
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,920
OK.

146
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,860
This graph represents the space of the water tanks,

147
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,510
which we're labeling with Bs now,

148
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,150
which represent buffers, which represent

149
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,440
storage areas in the factory.

150
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,630
Now the arrows in this graph represents how the water

151
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,360
can flow in the two tanks.

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,350
For example, when the first valve is open

153
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,140
and the last two valves are closed,

154
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,210
we're symbolizing that as one, zero, zero.

155
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,460
That means the first thing is open-- that's a one--

156
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,910
and the other two are closed-- those are zeros.

157
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,860
What happens then is that the first tank starts filling up,

158
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,280
but the second tank stays at the same level.

159
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,290
And for that reason, the arrow is moving to the right.

160
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,760
Another condition would be that the first two valves are open

161
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,220
and the last valve is closed.

162
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,300
In that case, the water in the first tank stays constant,

163
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,000
but the second tank starts going up until it becomes full.

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,190
When the second tank becomes full,

165
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,830
that's where the first tank starts accumulating water.

166
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,640
And that keeps going until it reaches the upper right corner.

167
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,480
You can imagine other scenarios.

168
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,860
OK.

169
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,120
So this is after the animation.

170
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,390
Now if we look at what happens, we'll

171
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,040
notice that some parts of the space get darker.

172
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,780
Other parts stay lighter.

173
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,110
Those that are darker represent the higher density states.

174
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,179
Notice, though, that when a tank becomes full,

175
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,030
it tends to stay full for a while.

176
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,880
When it becomes empty, it tends to stay empty for a while.

177
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,549
So what we have is that in the interior of this space,

178
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,350
we really have a two-dimensional density,

179
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,230
where we can only describe the probability

180
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:54,370
by looking at the probability of being in a small area.

181
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,220
The edges of the rectangle, we actually

182
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,230
have one-dimensional densities, because when a tank becomes

183
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,720
full, it stays full, although the other tank can gain or lose

184
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,730
material.

185
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,800
Eventually, some of the corners have actual probabilities, not

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,690
densities at all anymore.

187
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,200
You can think of probabilities as zero-dimensional densities.

188
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,030
So we have a probability, for example,

189
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,650
of both tanks being full--

190
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,110
the probability of the first tank being full

191
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,940
and the second tank being empty and so forth.

192
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,700
If we looked at the discrete system,

193
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,100
the state space would look like this,

194
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,690
where the size of the dots represent the probabilities

195
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,950
of each of those states.

196
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,900
So we have integer numbers of parts in the first tank,

197
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,360
integer number of parts in the second tank,

198
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,812
and different probabilities.

199
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:49,312
