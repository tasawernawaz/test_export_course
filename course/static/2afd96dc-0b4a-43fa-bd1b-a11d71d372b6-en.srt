00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,210


1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,160
While probability may seem to be about imprecise uncertain

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,600
phenomena, probability calculations are precise

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,940
and they can model important features of the real world

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,477
very well.

5
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:14,560
They apply equally well to the frequency and state

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,030
of belief interpretations.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,610
This week will be a very short course on the basics

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,930
of probability theory.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,000
We will focus on those parts of the theory that

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,700
will be useful in understanding random events and factories,

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,270
and their consequences.

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,030
We'll only be scratching the surface

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,734
of a vast body of knowledge.

14
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:32,150
The axioms of probability are very

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,940
important because all quantitative probability

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,030
methods are based on them.

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,390


18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,520
Suppose we want to describe an experiment which

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,630
has more than one outcome.

20
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,750
We'll define the universe, U, to be

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,570
the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.

22
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,330
The elements of U are called samples.

23
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,920
E1, E2, and so forth, are subsets of U.

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,917
A special subset is the null or empty set,

25
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,125
the set that has no elements.

26
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,840


27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,860
P is a function of sets that has the following property.

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,730
First of all, the probability of any subset is between 0 and E1.

29
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,430
The probability of the universe is E1.

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,290
The probability of the empty set is 0.

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,660
And, if E1 and E2 are disjoint, that

32
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,190
is the intersection is empty, they have no samples in common.

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,150
Then P of the union of EI and EJ is

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,730
equal to P of EI plus P of EJ.

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,090


36
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,710
Technically, P is a measure.

37
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,260
You can think of a measure as a generalization of area

38
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,580
or volume.

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,800
If you think of the universe as a big plot of land,

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,660
then some of the subsets are small plots

41
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,550
of land inside the universe.

42
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,710
The last two axioms are very natural.

43
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,740
The area of A set of no land is zero,

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,270
and the area of A set of land which

45
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,490
consists of two non-overlapping plots

46
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,740
is the sum of their areas.

47
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,110
All right, some notation.

48
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,660
Omega, lowercase omega, is often used

49
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,509
as the symbol for a generic sample,

50
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,140
subsets of U. The E's are called events.

51
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,220
And P of E is the probability of event E.

52
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,960
Technically, P is a measure.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,750
You can think of a measure as a generalization of an area

54
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,470
or volume.

55
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,380
If you think the universe is one big plot of land,

56
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,180
then some of the subsets are smaller plots

57
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,220
of land inside the universe.

58
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,650
The last two axioms are very natural.

59
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,870
The area of a set of no land is zero,

60
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,765
and the area of a set of land which consists of two

61
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:42,930
non-overlapping plots is the sum of their area's.

62
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,820
So, let's look at some examples.

63
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,620
Throw a single die.

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,070
The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

65
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,890
Omega can be any one of those values.

66
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,460
Here's another example, more closely related

67
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,020
to manufacturing.

68
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,010
Let's say that N of T is the number of parts in inventory

69
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,710
at time T. Then omega is the set of numbers N of 1, N of 2,

70
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,210
and so forth.

71
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,130
That's called a sample path.

72
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,400
An event can be defined by a statement.

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,860
For example, E is the event that there

74
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,600
are six parts in the buffer at time t equals 12.

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,910
This is the formal notation for that.

76
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,260
So E is the set of all omega, such that N of 12 equals 6.

77
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,480
And that's written in the last line,

78
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,640
which is actually spoken the same way as what I just read.

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,980


80
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,590
Here's an illustration of a discrete sample space.

81
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,350
The circles represent samples.

82
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,410
The color of the circles indicates the probability.

83
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,310
Now, imagine that we have a dart thrower who's throwing darts

84
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,440
at this board, and the darts are going to land in these circles.

85
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,540
In fact, let's make it interesting by blindfolding

86
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,220
the dart thrower.

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,800
Now, the graphical notation, here,

88
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,250
is that the darker circles represent higher probabilities

89
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,550
and the lighter circles represent lower probabilities.

90
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,640
So when the DART thrower throws his darts,

91
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,910
we get more of them tending to land in the darker circles

92
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,790
and fewer of them landing in the lighter circles.

93
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,080
But it's not uniform, and there's always a probability

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,450
that we could get more in some of the lighter circles

95
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,930
than in some of the darker ones.

96
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,210
This is a thought experiment only.

97
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,010
Do not actually try this out.

98
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,250
Do not do this at home.

99
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,320


100
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Venn diagrams are useful to illustrate set theory,

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,870
and they work--

102
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,326
and they're useful for here, as well.

103
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:53,960
A is a subset of U, so that's an event.

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,560
A bar is the notation for the set of all elements

105
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,380
that are not in A.

106
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,420
Then, according to the last axiom of probability,

107
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,310
P of A bar is equal to 1 minus P of A.

108
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,350
The last axiom tells us the probability

109
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,650
of the union of two sets, whose intersection is an empty set.

110
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,420
What about two sets that do have some elements in common?

111
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,300
That probability is given by the formulas shown.

112
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,420
We have to subtract off the probability of the intersection

113
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,530
to avoid counting that intersection twice.

114
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,590
Independent events are ones in which the occurrence of one

115
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,360
has no effect on whether the other occurs.

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,720
Therefore, the probability of both occurring

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,480
is the product of each one occurring.

118
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,089
Here's an example.

119
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,005
In this example, imagine that the dart thrower

120
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:44,990
is throwing darts at the irregular grid, which is shown

121
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,540
at the bottom of the slide.

122
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,840
Now, the grid is divided in such a way

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,440
that the upper left figure shows the probabilities of landing

124
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,960
in vertical strips.

125
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,650
And the upper right shows the probability of the dart landing

126
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,690
in horizontal strips.

127
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,280
But those two are independent of one another.

128
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,030
So, when we threw the dart at the grid,

129
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,780
the probability of it flowing in a specific place,

130
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,600
whether the dark lands in a given

131
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,000
horizontal strip and a given vertical strip is independent.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,620
The probability that it lands in the box shown

133
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,390
is the product of the probability

134
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,710
that it lands in that horizontal strip, and the probability

135
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,570
that it lands in the vertical strip.

136
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,350
The probability of the horizontal strip is 0.179,

137
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,840
the probability of the vertical strip is 0.05,

138
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,080
so the probability of landing in that specific box is 0.0089.

139
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,530
Conditional probability is a very important concept.

140
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,270
If A and B are not independent events,

141
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,780
then knowing that B has occurred affects the probability

142
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,490
that A has occurred.

143
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,220
What is the probability that a dart lands in A, if I know

144
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,380
that the dart has landed in B?

145
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,860
If B is a subset of A, the probability is 1.

146
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,290
If there's a large overlap between A and B,

147
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,670
then that probability is high.

148
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,510
On the other hand, if A and B are disjoint, in other words,

149
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,540
they have no elements in common, then the probability is zero.

150
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,840
Conditional probability is the probability

151
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,230
that A has occurred, given that we know that B has occurred.

152
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,020
In order for the dart to land in A, given

153
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,060
that it has landed in B, it must land

154
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,150
in the intersection of A and B. Therefore,

155
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,980
the probability that it has landed in A,

156
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,320
given that it has landed in B, is the probability

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,324
of the intersection divided by the probability of B.

158
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:41,240
So, here's an example.

159
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,130
Let's throw a die.

160
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,440
Let's call A the event of getting an odd number, 1, 3,

161
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,810
or 5.

162
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,120
And B is the event of getting a number less than or equal to 3,

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,750
which is 1, 2, or 3.

164
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,600
Then, the probability of A and the probability of B

165
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,350
are both 1/2.

166
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,850


167
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,880
The probability of A intersection B,

168
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,000
is just the probability of getting a 1 or 3,

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,950
and that's one third.

170
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,780
That's two possibilities out of six.

171
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,930


172
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,010
So, the probability of A given B is the probability

173
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,560
of the intersection divided by the probability of B,

174
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,800
which is 2/3.

175
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,520
And, one way of thinking about that,

176
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,000
is that the intersection is 1 or 3,

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,700
and the probability of getting A is getting 1 or 3, but not 5.

178
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,553
So, that's 2/3.

179
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,360
The law of total probability deals

180
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,530
with the following question.

181
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,750
Suppose event A can occur in several different ways.

182
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,840
Specifically, A might occur if E!

183
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,930
or E2 or E3, and so forth, occurs.

184
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,650
We know the probability of E1, E2, and E3 occurring.

185
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,290
And we know the conditional probability of A occurring,

186
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,400
given that E1 E2 and so on and so forth, has occurred.

187
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,820
So, what is the probability of A occurring?

188
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,510
So, let's look at the slide.

189
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,810
So we going to build this up simply, from simple cases

190
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,480
to something more complicated.

191
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,960
Let B be this set, which is the union of C and D.

192
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,310
And C and D are disjoint.

193
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,920
They have no elements in common.

194
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,730
In that case, the probability of A given C

195
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,210
is probability of A intersection C, divided by probability of C,

196
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,270
is just the definition of condition probability.

197
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,360
And probability of A given D is the probability--

198
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,840
is the probability of the intersection of A and D,

199
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,500
divided by probability of D.

200
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,800
In addition, the probability of C given B

201
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,490
is equal to the probability of C intersection B, divided

202
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,190
by the probability of B, which is just probability

203
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,270
of C over probability of B. Because C intersection B is

204
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,130
just the same as C. Similarly, the probability of D

205
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:05,330
given B is just probability of D divided by probability of B.

206
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,710
Now, we can write the intersection of A and B,

207
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,910
as the intersection of A with C union D, which

208
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:20,510
is A intersection C, union A intersection D. A intersection

209
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,850
C and A intersection D are disjoint.

210
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,790


211
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,840
So the probability of A intersection B

212
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,460
is just the probability of A intersection with C union

213
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,510
D, which is just the probability of A intersection

214
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,660
C plus a intersection D, because of that disjointness.

215
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,360


216
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,690
From the definition of conditional probability,

217
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,080
we can write this equation as P of A given B times

218
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,770
probability of B, equals P of A given C times the probability

219
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,470
of C, plus the probability of A given

220
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,320
D times the probability of D. If we divide through,

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,900
by probability of B, then we get the equation shown.

222
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,300
And that turns into probability of A given B equals probability

223
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,960
of A given C, times the probability of C given B,

224
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,730
plus the probability of A given D,

225
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,811
times the probability of D given B.

226
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:21,310
OK.

227
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,180
That looks nice.

228
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,370
Let's see where we can go from there.

229
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,670
So, a very important case is when

230
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,470
C union D which is equal to B, is just the whole universe.

231
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,030
In other words, the dart could land in C

232
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,430
or it could land in D. No other place.

233
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,240
And so, we're asking whether the dart has landed in A.

234
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:51,220
So A intersection B is equal to A so probability of A

235
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,610
is equal to probability of A intersection C plus probability

236
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,620
of A intersection D, which finally leads to this equation.

237
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,500
Probability of A is equal to probability

238
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,600
of A given C times the probability of C,

239
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,460
plus the probability of A given D,

240
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,790
times the probability of D. OK.

241
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,030
Let's generalize that and then see what it means.

242
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,670
The generalization is when we have lots of events.

243
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,420
So all of these E events, together

244
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,330
cover the whole set, the whole universe,

245
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,360
and they have no overlap.

246
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,800
And the A event is shown by the circle.

247
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,940
More generally, A and E1 through EK are events.

248
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,590
And EI intersection EJ equals the empty set for all I

249
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,910
not equal to J, and the union of all the E's are

250
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,790
the universal set.

251
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,740
And we typically say that, as the set

252
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,950
of the EJ's is mutually exclusive

253
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,440
and collectively exhaustive.

254
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,270
Then, the sum of all the probabilities of EJ is equal

255
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,800
to 1, but more importantly, probability of A is the sum

256
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,340
of probability of A given EJ times the probability of EJ,

257
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,880
over all the J's.

258
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,040
This can be illustrated by a graph, in this figure.

259
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,760
If I know that EJ has occurred, then there's

260
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,040
a probability that A has occurred,

261
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,012
which is given by P of A given E1, and so forth.

262
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,470
This kind of graph is going to come

263
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,150
up later when we talked about--

264
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,580
when we talk about dynamic processes.

265
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,620


266
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,760
Here's an example.

267
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,050
It's kind of silly, but I think it makes the point.

268
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,580
Let's set A the event that I will have a cold tomorrow.

269
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,420
E1 is the set that it says that it's raining today,

270
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,520
E2 is the event that it's snowing today,

271
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,260
and E3 is that it's sunny today.

272
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,590


273
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,090
So, we're going to assume that those

274
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,390
are all the possibilities, and it can only

275
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,840
either rain or snow or be sunny, and not two of them

276
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,160
at the same time.

277
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,680
So, the event A intersection E1 is the event

278
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,320
that I will have a cold tomorrow and it's raining today.

279
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,050


280
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,380
P of A, given E1, is the probability

281
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,930
I will have a cold tomorrow given that it's raining today,

282
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,310
and so forth.

283
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,860
So, the event that I will have a cold tomorrow

284
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,130
is the same as either the event that I

285
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,950
will have a cold tomorrow and it's raining today,

286
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,610
or I will have a cold tomorrow and it's snowing today,

287
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,430
or I will have a cold tomorrow and it's sunny today.

288
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,550


289
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,290
So, because of all the assumptions that we made.

290
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,980
So, the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow

291
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,480
is equal to the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow

292
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,240
and it's raining today, plus the probability that I

293
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,820
will have a cold tomorrow and that snow today,

294
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,100
plus the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow

295
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,030
and it's sunny today.

296
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,710


297
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,400
So, the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow

298
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,890
is the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow, given

299
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,830
that it's raining today, times the probability that it's

300
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,900
raining today.

301
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,990
Plus, the probability I will have cold tomorrow,

302
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,690
given that it's snowing today, times the probability that it's

303
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,440
snowing today.

304
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,960


305
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,750
Plus, the probability that I will have a cold tomorrow,

306
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,510
given that it's sunny today, times the probability that it's

307
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,839
sunny today, which we can just write this way.

308
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,630
And, so, that's the illustration of the law

309
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,140
of total probability.
