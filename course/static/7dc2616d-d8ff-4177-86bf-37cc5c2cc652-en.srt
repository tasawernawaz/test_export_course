1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,250
This is a schematic diagram of a two-card kanban system.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,542
It is very highly simplified.

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,060
Now there are two WIP buffers and two kanban buffers.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,790
In a two-card kanban system, there

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,790
are production-ordering kanbans and withdrawal kanbans.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,920
In this picture, the green represents the flows

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,540
of withdrawal kanban, and the red

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,319
shows the flow of production-ordering kanban.

9
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,860
The withdrawal kanbans are like order

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,910
slips from the downstream stage, telling the upstream stage

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,710
what they need.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,810
It is often used when there's a long distance

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,390
between operations or work cells.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,070
If the squares represent factories,

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,260
there's a truck traveling between them.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,260
If they are two stages that are not adjacent to one another

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,080
in the same large factory, there may be a forklift

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,779
doing the transportation.

19
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:51,070
It's also used when parts are delivered to the machines

20
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,720
in different sized batches.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,230
To summarize the next few slides, on the upstream side,

22
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,484
there's a limited number of production-ordering kanbans.

23
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:01,150
When a part arrives and there's at least

24
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,450
one production-ordering kanban, the part gets an operation,

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,460
and the kanban is attached.

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,590
If there are no production-ordering kanbans

27
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,890
in the kanban buffer, no operation takes place.

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,960
All those kanbans are in the upstream output

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,330
buffer attached to parts.

30
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,280
If there's a withdrawal kanban in its buffer,

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,070
it's swapped with the production order in kanban.

32
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,350
The production order in kanban goes to its buffer,

33
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,380
and the part, with the withdrawal kanban attached,

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,480
is transported to the input WIP buffer

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,760
of the downstream machine.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,740
The part waits in that buffer until the machine

37
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,580
is ready for it.

38
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,370
When it is, the withdrawal kanban goes to its buffer,

39
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,300
the part gets an operation, and then moves on.

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,530
OK, now for some details.

41
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,780
First, the upstream side.

42
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,460
These pictures are very highly simplified, as I said.

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,990
We're only showing a single part and one or two kanbans.

44
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,280
The parts are blue, the production-ordering kanbans

45
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,710
are red, and the withdrawal kanbans are green.

46
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,330
The upstream machine does an operation

47
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,810
when its previous operation or downtime is completed,

48
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,970
and there is a production-ordering kanban

49
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,000
in the production-ordering kanban buffer,

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,280
and a part is available.

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,950
After the operation, the kanban is attached to the part,

52
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,220
and they move to the output WIP buffer of the upstream machine

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,130
together.

54
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,620
The upstream cycle repeats.

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,380
If the withdrawal kanban buffer is not empty,

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,240
the production ordering kanban is

57
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,250
removed from a part in the output WIP

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,100
buffer of the upstream machine and moved

59
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,140
to the production-ordering kanban buffer.

60
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,980
A withdrawal kanban is attached to that part.

61
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,410
The part is made ready for transportation.

62
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,230
Transportation occurs according to some specific protocol.

63
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,840
There may be a transportation batch size, where there may

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,000
be a transportation schedule.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,070
If parts are being transported a long distance,

66
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,100
they might have to wait for a scheduled departure,

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,720
or a departure may only take place

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,258
when there's a certain number of parts to transport.

69
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:59,890


70
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,750
When the previous operation or downtime

71
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,100
of the downstream machine is completed and is not blocked,

72
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,610
the downstream machine takes apart

73
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,980
from its input WIP buffer.

74
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,750
The withdrawal kanban removed from the part.

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,460
The withdrawal kanbans are transported

76
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,760
to withdraw buffer according to a transportation protocol.

77
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,980
Several withdrawal kanbans may accumulate

78
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,116
before they're sent upstream.

79
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:26,850
The downstream machine does an operation on the part,

80
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,550
and the part is sent to its next step.

81
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,260
The downstream cycle repeats.

82
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,240
So what happens when there's a machine failure

83
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,920
or other stoppage of a machine?

84
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,210
The withdrawal kanban are not added

85
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,300
to the upstream withdrawal kanban buffer.

86
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,180
The ones that are there are removed from that buffer

87
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,790
and attached to parts as the upstream machine does

88
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,500
operations A part in the output WIP

89
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,710
buffer of the upstream machine gains a withdrawal kanban

90
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,890
and is transported to the input buffer of the failed machine.

91
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,680
This continues until the upstream withdrawal kanban

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,280
buffer is empty.

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,107
No parts are added to the output buffer of the failed machine.

94
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:12,440
The parts that remain in the output buffer of the failed

95
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,840
machine have their production-ordering kanbans

96
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,570
replaced by withdrawal kanbans, and the parts

97
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,550
are moved to the input WIP buffer

98
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,210
of the downstream machine.

99
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,900
This continues until the output buffer of the failed machine

100
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,400
is empty.

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,520


102
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,090
When the failed machine is repaired,

103
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,145
the normal cycle resumes.

104
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,030


105
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,370
There are other kinds of kanbans.

106
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,070
The supplier kanbans are the same as withdrawal kanbans,

107
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,490
except they go to an external supplier.

108
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,000
Signal kanbans are similar to the production-ordering kanbans

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,760
but sent to a production station when inventory goes down

110
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,442
to a reorder point.

111
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:53,540
A material requisition kanban is also

112
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,050
similar to a production-ordering kanban,

113
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,830
but it's sent to a material storage area

114
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,640
when local inventory goes down to a reorder point.

115
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,710
And there are plenty others.

116
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,350
This is a summary of the kanban discipline.

117
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,350
It only works if everybody follows it.

118
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,810
Each process withdraws the necessary products

119
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,970
from the previous in necessary quantities

120
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,540
at the necessary time.

121
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,290
To enforce this, workers must first be won over.

122
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,810
This is partly out of respect for people,

123
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,310
and partly because if people don't

124
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,110
see the value in this discipline,

125
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,000
they will follow their instincts.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,740
And their instincts tell them that it's

127
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,170
natural to keep making parts because those parts will

128
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,760
be needed eventually.

129
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,000
Kanbans must be attached to product.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,220
Each process produces only what is withdrawn

131
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,620
by the subsequent process.

132
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,130
Defective products are never moved to the next process.

133
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,210
This is very important.

134
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,960
They should be reworked if possible.

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,630
If not, they should be scrapped.

136
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,510
Otherwise, they waste the time of all the machines and people

137
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,370
that operate on them later.

138
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,290
Also, they may escape the factory

139
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,880
and be delivered to a customer.

140
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,266
That is very bad.

141
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,640
In addition, the machine that did

142
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,890
the operation that made the part bad

143
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,490
should be investigated and repaired.

144
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,010


145
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,940
The number of kanbans should be minimized,

146
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,630
and the kanban system should be used

147
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,906
to adapt to small fluctuations in demand.

148
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:16,406
