00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460


1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,580
The purpose of an operation in the manufacturing process

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,980
is to bring a work piece closer to a state in which it

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,540
can be sold.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,550
The design of processes and machines

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,220
to implement those processes is obviously important,

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,480
but it's not the subject of this course.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,100
We're interested in how the characteristics of operations

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,620
affect the flow of material through the production process.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,470
We'll be concerned with discrete parts

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,970
manufacturing, not production that

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,950
involves the flow of fluids.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,310
This leaves out oil refining and other chemical processes.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,754
We'll start with a very basic view of a typical operation.

14
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:37,170
There are many kinds of processes,

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,510
but they have certain features in common.

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,440
For example, they all take a work piece into a work area.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,840
The piece spends some time in there, and then it leaves.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,330
Many processes also take consumables,

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,940
such as cooling fluid for metal cutting or chemicals

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,460
for semiconductor fabrication.

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,320
Most operations require a machine,

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,080
and some need a human operator.

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,310
Operations also generate waste.

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,239
For example, metal cutting operations create metal chips,

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,740
and also have used contaminated fluid to dispose of.

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,390
This is generic and typical.

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,550
There are operations that differ in some details.

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,520
For example, assembly processes take more than one kind of part

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,730
in and send a single part out.

30
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,030
One thing they have in common is that the operation cannot take

31
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,730
place until all the required items are present at the same

32
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,740
place at the same time.

33
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,510
The requirements include a place to put

34
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,340
the completed part and the mechanism

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,320
to dispose of the waste.

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,660
If there are no parts for the machine to work on,

37
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,610
we say that it is starved.

38
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,430
If the next destination for the parts is not available for some

39
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,190
reason-- for example, if a storage buffer is full--

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,590
we say the operation is blocked.

41
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,380
The operation could be prevented if the operator is not there,

42
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,750
or if the machine is under repair or maintenance.

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,580
The important point is that nothing happens

44
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,100
until everything is present.

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,780
If any one of these items is absent,

46
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,930
the operation must wait until the missing one arrives.

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,290
Whatever does not arrive last must wait.

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,780
Idleness is a loss of some of the productive capability

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,530
of a component of the factory.

50
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,020
This is undesirable.

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,300
One goal of manufacturing systems engineering

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,900
is to minimize unnecessary waiting.

53
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,580
But because of the complexity and variability of a factory,

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,220
it's impossible to eliminate all the waiting.

55
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,440
Therefore, we want the most valuable components

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,600
to wait the least.

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,310
There are different names for different things waiting.

58
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,490
Inventory is parts waiting.

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,380
If raw material is expensive, inventory

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,440
is expensive, so we emphasize minimizing inventory.

61
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,090
There are other reasons as well, which we'll discuss later.

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,830
If capital investment is expensive,

63
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,980
we emphasize maximizing machine utilization.

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,856
So when machines are waiting, we call that underutilization.

65
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,230
When operators are waiting, we'll

66
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,600
describe that as an idle workforce.

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,300
If workers must be highly skilled and expensively

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,160
trained, we emphasize keeping them busy.

69
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,930
Reductions in the availability or

70
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,000
increased variability in the availability

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,630
of any of these items increasing waiting in the rest of them

72
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,390
and reduces the performance of the system.

73
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,490
When an operation is prevented from taking place

74
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,490
for any reason, that stoppage can propagate and cause

75
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,920
idleness at other parts of the factory.

76
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,040
For example, if a machine is under repair for a long time,

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,140
work pieces can accumulate in the storage area

78
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,550
upstream of it.

79
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,156
If that buffer becomes full, one or more operations

80
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:28,530
upstream of that machine may become blocked and prevented

81
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,850
from working.

82
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,160
Similarly, if a machine is down long enough,

83
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,890
a storage area downstream may be depleted,

84
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,100
and this may cause starvation in downstream work stations.

85
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,900
Now we're going to describe some standard system architectures.

86
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,450
A flow line is a sequence of machines and buffers.

87
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,380
Parts arrive from outside the system at the first machine.

88
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,410
After a part's operation is completed at that machine,

89
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,970
it goes to a storage buffer and stays

90
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,490
there until the next machine is available.

91
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,410
It gets an operation of the second machine,

92
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,868
and then goes to the second buffer,

93
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:02,492
and then to the third machine, and so forth.

94
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,200
Since all of the parts require operations

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,900
on the same machines in the same sequence,

96
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,090
the parts are generally very similar or identical

97
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,570
to one another.

98
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,290
This is therefore used for low variety manufacturing.

99
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,570
High volume is often low variety.

100
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,490
The high volume justifies the investment

101
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,920
in machines that are dedicated to a small number of part

102
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,590
types, possibly just one.

103
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,250
Why are there buffers?

104
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,754
They are there because machines fail.

105
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:28,920
If there were no buffers, the failure of one machine

106
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,500
would stop all the others very quickly.

107
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,540
With buffers, if one machine stops,

108
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,310
the machine upstream can keep working

109
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,350
until the buffer between them fills up, and is

110
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,940
therefore blocked.

111
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,400
If the machine that's stopped starts up again

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,830
before the buffer is full, the upstream machine

113
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,750
does not have to stop.

114
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,449
Also, the machine downstream can keep

115
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,990
working until the buffer between them

116
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,410
becomes empty, which means that it's starved.

117
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,600
If work resumes before that buffer empties,

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,510
the downstream machine's work is not interrupted.

119
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,000
Stoppages can be due to failures, maintenance,

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,070
blockages, or starvations.

121
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,530
Blockages and starvations lead to the propagation

122
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,990
of the original disruption.

123
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,670
Consequently, larger buffers lead

124
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,950
to less propagation, and therefore higher production

125
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,730
rates.

126
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,670
However, larger buffers lead to greater cost of inventory

127
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,382
and the space allocated to holding inventory.

128
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,590
This means that there's a trade-off between inventory

129
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,239
costs and production rate.

130
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,280
We will examine that trade-off in the second part

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,150
of this course.

132
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,850
Let's see a system like this in action.

133
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,270


134
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,326
This is a representation of the kind of flow line

135
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,700
we were just talking about, where

136
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,290
we have a sequence of machines and buffers.

137
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,909
The machines are unreliable, so they go up and down.

138
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,200
When they're up, they're white.

139
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,450
When they're down, they're red.

140
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,840
The buffers can hold up to 25 parts.

141
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,520
And the little green squares inside them

142
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,350
represent the parts they have.

143
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,660
And you'll see the movement of parts in there.

144
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,390
What you should also see is that when a machine fails,

145
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,280
the upstream buffer starts to fill up,

146
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,250
and the downstream buffer, if it has any parts in it,

147
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,465
will start to empty.

148
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:04,350
So let's go.

149
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:23,170


150
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,400
We've made the machines a little bit more unreliable

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,844
than you'd probably see in a real factory,

152
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:30,010
just so that we can get to see some action going on.

153
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:45,960


154
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,930
In this model, all the machines have the same operation time.

155
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,010


156
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,930
And the time that we're counting is the number

157
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,230
of operations time since the beginning of the simulation.

158
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,670
You can see that this is a pretty inefficient system,

159
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,950
because we've already reached time 110,

160
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,090
and there are only 39 parts produced.

161
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:16,162


162
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:18,370
Factory seems to be having a run of bad luck with all

163
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,150
those machines down.

164
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,784
Oh.

165
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:22,450
Getting back up.

166
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:30,891


167
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:31,390
OK.

168
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,890
Maybe we've seen all we need to see.

169
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,340


170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,620
For our purposes, an assembly system

171
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,170
can be thought of as a generalization of the flow line

172
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,940
that we just talked about.

173
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,429
The difference here is that assembly machines

174
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:48,220
take different parts from different buffers

175
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,880
to do their operations.

176
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,320
Consequently, they can be starved

177
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,570
if any one of the upstream buffers is empty.

178
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,180
Here's a very complex assembly.

179
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,950
You can see how many different operations.

180
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,350
Each of those little dots represent an operation.

181
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,270
And there's very, very many parts.

182
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,540
Some factories involve looping flow,

183
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,160
in which parts or other items visit the same machines more

184
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,320
than once.

185
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,180
Determining the performance of these systems

186
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,340
must take this into account.

187
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,260
Here, parts or fixtures travel in a closed loop.

188
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,540
The routes are determined.

189
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,870
The number of pallets in the loop is constant.

190
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,270
We saw this kind of loop in the HP example.

191
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,250
Parts are attached to pallets or fixtures

192
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,290
as they enter the system.

193
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,600
Essentially, the first operation is the assembly

194
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,580
of a part and a pallet.

195
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,069
This assembly visits the machines

196
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:37,610
and waits in the buffers between them

197
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,559
just like in the flow line.

198
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,985
The last machine is a disassembly.

199
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:43,460
The part exits the system and the pallet

200
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,960
is recycled back to the first machine.

201
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,970
The motivation for this is that the part only

202
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,400
has to be attached to the pallet once,

203
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,550
instead of being attached to fixturing at each station.

204
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,820
This reduces the danger of damage to the part.

205
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,620
In addition, the fixturing at each station

206
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,800
is simplified, because it is the same for all the stations.

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,160
This also makes it easier to deal with different part types.

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,110
This also limits inventory, because the number

209
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,690
of parts in the system is less than or equal to the number

210
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,790
of pallets.

211
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,350
Now, the number of pallets enters

212
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,710
into the trade-off between inventory and production rate.

213
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,760
A second kind of loop, which is called reentrant,

214
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,280
has parts returning to machines they have visited before

215
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,800
to get more operations.

216
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,359
This is a schematic of a system that produces two part types.

217
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,900
The first one that we're showing here

218
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,120
has a simple flow, like a flow line.

219
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,250
After the part gets its fourth operation,

220
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,360
it leaves the system.

221
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,620
The second part type has a more complex path.

222
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,270
After it gets its fourth operation,

223
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,330
it goes back to the first machine for a fifth operation,

224
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,250
and then to machines 2, 3, and 4 again.

225
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,010
Then it leaves.

226
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,160
The routes are determined.

227
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,010
The number of parts in the loop varies.

228
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,010
Semiconductor fabrication is highly reentrant.

229
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,220
Semiconductor chips have multiple layers,

230
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,740
and each layer gets similar operations.

231
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,830
It's cheaper to use one machine for all the similar operations

232
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,380
on different layers than to have different machines

233
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,600
for those operations on each layer.

234
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,030
The downside of this is that the management of the system

235
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,270
is much more complicated than the ones we've already seen.

236
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,700
Another extension of the flow line is a rework loop.

237
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,120
This is a common kind of material flow.

238
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,190
There's an inspection station.

239
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,070
Features of parts are measured to determine their quality

240
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,180
at that station.

241
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,360
If the quality is acceptable, the part moves on.

242
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,110
If the quality is not acceptable,

243
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,290
but the error is repairable, the part

244
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,050
goes back to get the operation redone,

245
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,940
and may have to get another operation first,

246
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,640
to undo the bad operation.

247
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,950
If the error is not acceptable and not repairable,

248
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,380
the part is rejected and scrapped.

249
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,690
There are actually two reasons for inspection.

250
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,910
One is to prevent bad parts from reaching customers.

251
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,270
The second is to detect where are other deterioration

252
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,580
on the machines that did the operations whose results

253
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,810
are inspected.

254
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,690
This may trigger a repair or maintenance

255
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,280
of the faulty machine.

256
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,320
In this kind of system, the routes are random.

257
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,975
The number of parts in the loop varies.

258
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,475
And the system is already described.

259
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:14,820
The part variety is low, and the volume is high.

260
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,070
This allows the factory to be organized according

261
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,050
to the sequence of operations.

262
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,550
Job shops are different.

263
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,660
They deliver a wide variety of parts, often in small batches.

264
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,300
It is not cost effective to dedicate a set of machines

265
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,600
to a small batch of parts that may not be ordered again.

266
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,210
The machines are not organized according to the process flow,

267
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,790
because there is no common process flow.

268
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,930
Often, instead, machines are grouped by department--

269
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,550
a mill department, a lathe department, and so forth.

270
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,070
There's a great variety of products.

271
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,190
Different products follow different paths.

272
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,842
And the management of this system is complex.

273
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:52,342
