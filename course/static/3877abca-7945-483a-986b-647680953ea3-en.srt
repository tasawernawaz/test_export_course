00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760


1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,920
The heart of the Toyota production system

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,120
is the continual reduction of waste.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,730
Variability is a source of waste, but not the only one.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,740
The Japanese word is "muda."

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,600
"Waste" means the production of defects, manpower inefficiency,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,080
excess inventories, missed delivery dates,

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,750
and, in general, waste of manpower, outputs, money,

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,570
space, time, information, and so forth.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,890
The goals include the reduction of unnecessary setup time,

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,300
including time wasted looking for things, defective materials

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,220
and products, clutter, late deliveries of materials

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,780
and supplies to work areas, not just the customers,

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,880
and unsafe conditions.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,430
All this is important in the term 5s, which

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,470
are represented by five Japanese words

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,990
starting in the English language with S.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,890
"Seiri" means don't clutter up the factory with useless stuff.

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,500
"Seiton" means make things easy to find.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,550
"Seiso" is daily cleaning and less frequent major cleaning.

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,020
This can keep machines working.

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,070
The last two items are aimed at managers.

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,850
Make sure that the last three are done and encourage workers,

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,320
listen to their ideas, and don't criticize excessively.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,660
Visual control means that things should be easy to see.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,950
In the case of seiri, which means to get rid of stuff,

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,180
the items to be discarded should be systematically labeled.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,240
For seitoin, which means make things easy to find,

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,090
you select where things should go and then label them

29
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,340
permanently.

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,650
And more visual control will be described

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,530
in the andon discussion below.

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,820
Another important Japanese word is "jidoka," or autonomation.

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,500
This doesn't mean automation.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,090
It includes automation.

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,220
What it really means is the autonomous check

36
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,650
of the abnormal in a process.

37
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,250
It includes mechanisms to detect defects and mechanisms

38
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,220
to stop the line when defects are detected.

39
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,020
Autonomous really means local.

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Local machine controls and local people

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,980
stop or slow down the line, not central management.

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,610
If a machine produces a defect, it stops the whole line.

43
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,850
For manual operations, it's the workers that stop the line.

44
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,230
Another term is "poka-yoke," which means mistake-proofing--

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,280
a system for checking to prevent defects.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,720
The visible control system is an automated device

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,750
to stop or delay a line.

48
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,600
Workers have the power and responsibility to stop a line.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,040
For example, if a cycle time is supposed to be 70 seconds,

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,680
but it takes a certain worker 80 seconds to do his work,

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,660
he must stop the line.

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,780
Then supervisors and engineers must investigate.

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,820
Is the worker following instructions?

54
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,120
If not, they provide advice.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,140
If the worker is following instructions, ,

56
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,220
they try to eliminate wasteful actions,

57
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,020
shorten walking distances, or find other improvements.

58
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,430
Workers are often reluctant to stop the line.

59
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,270
The andon is an electric light board.

60
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,670
The board is large and high and visible

61
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,130
from all points in the factory.

62
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,290
The lights are color coded.

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,180
For example, when a worker delays a line,

64
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,530
he turns on a yellow light.

65
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,410
When a worker stops a line, he turns on a red light.

66
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,730
And there are other colored lights for other conditions.

67
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,010
Quality control circles are an important element in all this.

68
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,910
Improvement suggestions are obtained from workers

69
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,250
via quality control circles.

70
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,170
Workers know things that managers do not

71
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,400
know because they are intimately involved in the operations.

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,800
They can provide good ideas.

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,670
This system shows respect for workers

74
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,460
and improves their morale.

75
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,400
The kinds of suggestions include refinements

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,150
of manual operations, introduction of new machinery

77
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,830
or improvements in existing equipment,

78
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,250
or ways to economize on materials and supplies.

79
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,790
These quality control circles are formally structured.

80
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,010
There's participation by all workers,

81
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,350
and they're recognized by management.

82
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,779
The meetings are regularly scheduled,

83
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,060
and prizes and commendations are awarded

84
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,980
for really good suggestions.

85
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,650
To summarize, the Toyota production system

86
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,340
is a system for continuous improvement.

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,050
There is much more detail and many more areas

88
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,960
than I've discussed in the Toyota production system.

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,410
The major emphasis is to deal with variation--

90
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,470
to reduce it if possible, to respond to it appropriately

91
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,000
if not.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,030
The elements of the system are interrelated.

93
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,820
For example, it is only possible to mix models

94
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,550
if setup change times are short.

95
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,790
Respect for people is an integral part of the system.

96
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,180
This has been a very brief overview.

97
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,660
The Toyota production system has been extremely successful,

98
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,190
and it has been extremely influential.
