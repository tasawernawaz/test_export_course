<p>A music store is restocked weekly. The weekly demand for a best-selling CD is normal, with mean of 200 and standard deviation of 50. These CDs cost $8.00 per piece, and the store earns $4.50 per CD sold. Excess demand is lost (salvage value is $0); Customers go to a competitor's store rather than wait for resupply.</p>
