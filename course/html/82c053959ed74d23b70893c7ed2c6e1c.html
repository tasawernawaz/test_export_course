<h2>WEEK 1: Overview in Manufacturing systems &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8/28/2018<span style="font-size: 11pt;"></span></h2>
<p>The first week of this course is devoted to an overview of manufacturing systems: what they&nbsp;are, and what problems face designers and operators of these systems. We&rsquo;ll start off with a&nbsp;case that shows the benefits of the methods we will describe. We will go through some&nbsp;definitions and take a very basic look at the relationship between a single manufacturing&nbsp;operation and the system it is part of. We will establish one of the basic themes of this course:&nbsp;the effects of variability. We will describe some system architectures and we will discuss&nbsp;some important performance measures.</p>

<h2>WEEK 2: Probability &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/04/2018</h2>
<p>This is the first of three weeks that will discuss randomness. This is important because most&nbsp;variability is due to randomness and we need to be able to quantify it and its effects on system&nbsp;performance. The approach in this course is to provide intuition about randomness and&nbsp;variability, not primarily to teach mathematics, but some math will be needed. We define&nbsp;probability precisely and define such concepts as independence, conditional probability, the&nbsp;law of total probability, random variables, and others. We introduce some widely used&nbsp;probability distributions for discrete and continuous random variables.</p>

<h2>WEEK 3: Stochastic Processes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9/11/2018</h2>
<p>We build on the probability basics from last week to discuss random dynamic systems, which&nbsp;is what factories are. In a stochastic process, the state of a system evolves randomly over&nbsp;time and the present state influences the future. We focus on Markov processes, a class of&nbsp;stochastic processes that is very useful for modeling real-world systems. We study both&nbsp;discrete-time and continuous time Markov processes. We develop transition equations and&nbsp;we show how to use them to calculate performance measure of complex systems. We model&nbsp;single unreliable machines and relate their production rates to their failure and repair behavior.&nbsp;We will use these ideas later to study increases and decreases of inventories.</p>

<h2>WEEK 4: Queuing Theory &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9/18/18</h2>
<p>Queues are stochastic processes. Queuing models are widely used to study the arrivals and&nbsp;departures of people or items to a storage area. We will look at some simple models of&nbsp;individual queues to understand how the interaction of random arrival and departure&nbsp;processes affect the number of items in storage and the time that they must wait to leave the&nbsp;system. We define the capacity and utilization of such systems. Then we will consider&nbsp;networks of queues and use a network model to study the behavior of material flow in a&nbsp;flexible manufacturing system.</p>

<h2>WEEK 5:&nbsp;Inventory &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9/25/2018</h2>
<p>Inventory is a major issue in every factory. We show how some inventory is inevitable when&nbsp;variability is present in a system of flows. Inventory is necessary for a factory to meet some&nbsp;of its performance goals, such as having products available when customers want them or&nbsp;meeting a specified production rate target. However, it has costs. We will describe some&nbsp;inventory models that deal with issues such as the trade-off between the risk of having too&nbsp;little inventory to satisfy all customers and having too much so that some items are unsold.&nbsp;We will look at economies of scale: when it is worthwhile to buy or make more than you&nbsp;expect to need</p>

<h2>WEEK 6: Toyota Production System &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/2/2018</h2>
<p>The Toyota Production System has been successful and widely adopted and imitated&nbsp;throughout the world. In this set of videos we describe some of its key elements, particularly&nbsp;how it deals with variability and how it treats the people who are a part of the manufacturing&nbsp;system. We discuss kanban, production smoothing, reduction of setup time, improvement&nbsp;activities and other topics. We briefly discuss how the Toyota Production System was&nbsp;influenced by its historical context.</p>

<h2>WEEK 7: Single Part Type Manufacturing Systems &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/9/2018</h2>
<p>This week we describe some quantitative models of single-part-type flow lines. We start from&nbsp;a model of a single unreliable machine and then study a long line with several machines and&nbsp;infinite buffers. We introduce the concept of a bottleneck and calculate the production rate of&nbsp;the line. We use simulations to observe inventory accumulation. Then, we consider a line&nbsp;with several unreliable machines and no buffers. We calculate the production rate. These&nbsp;are two extremes: zero buffers having zero inventory and low rate and infinite buffers with&nbsp;large inventories and higher production rates.</p>
<p>Finally, we study two-machine lines with finite buffers. These models show how buffers affect&nbsp;production rate and inventory. They also show how the frequency and duration of disruptions&nbsp;affect these performance measures in ways that cannot be predicted by machine efficiency&nbsp;alone. We will continue this subject in the second part of this course.</p>
