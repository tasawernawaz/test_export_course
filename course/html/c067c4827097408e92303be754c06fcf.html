<p>An important&nbsp;note on the probability pre-requisite:</p>
<p>While we do dedicate this week to introducing the concepts of probability&nbsp;we need to lay&nbsp;the foundation for&nbsp;the rest of the class, this is by no means meant to be your first introduction to probability. As stated in the pre-requisites, we expect our learners to&nbsp;be comfortable with undergraduate-level&nbsp;calculus, probability and statistics. The material will ramp up fast and by week 3 we will expect you to be&nbsp;adept with the material we introduce in this week!</p>
<p>If this week is more than a refresher or review or if you are not confident you can pick up the concepts in week 2 quickly, we <strong>highly encourage</strong> you to take <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-part-1-mitx-6-041-1x" target="[object Object]">6.041.1x Introduction to Probability: Part I, Fundamentals</a>.</p>
