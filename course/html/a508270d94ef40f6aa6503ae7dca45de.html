<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In a quality-oriented production facility, each manufacturing operation ends with a test. The item may pass the test, fail it, or require rework. The external arrival process of items at operation \(Q\) &nbsp;is Poisson with a rate of 5 per hour. Each visit of each item to operation&nbsp;\(Q\)&nbsp;has these characteristics: a processing time that is exponential with a mean of 8 minutes (including the test), a probability 0</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">7 of passing the test, a probability 0</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">05 of failing it, and a probability 0</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">25 of requiring rework. If an item requires rework at operation&nbsp;\(Q\), it revisits operation&nbsp;\(Q\). If an item fails inspection, it is discarded.&nbsp;</span></p>
