<p>You are the Director of Operations of Second Best Buy, a retail chain, and you are planning the purchase of TVs for the first quarter of 2018. You will be buying 30" 1080i TVs and 42" 4K TVs. Last week, the marketing department delivered the following sales forecast:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>1080i TVs</li>
<ul><ol>
<li>The demand will follow a normal distribution with a mean of 2000 sets/quarter and a standard deviation of 300 sets/quarter.</li>
<li>The sale price, product cost, and salvage value of the TVs are respectively $800/set, $400/set, and $300/set.</li>

<ol><ol><ol>
<li>The sale price, product cost and salvage value are respectively $2000/set, $1000/set, and $900/set.</li>
<li>We do not have historic sales data for 4K TVs. Instead, we consider the following three scenarios:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Good: demand = 1200 sets/quarter, with probability 0.35.</li>
<li>Fair: demand = 800 sets/quarter, with probability 0.50.</li>
<li>Poor: demand = 400 sets/quarter, with probability 0.15.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
