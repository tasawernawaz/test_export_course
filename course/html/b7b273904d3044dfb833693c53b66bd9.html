<p>The <strong>Hungry Nerd Sandwich Truck Company</strong> needs some help in buying supplies for its truck which is parked outside of 77 Massachusetts Avenue every day - especially bread. From its experience, it needs 500 loaves of fresh bread on an average day to satisfy demand. The standard deviation of the number of loaves it needs is 200 loaves. Hungry Nerd must pay $.50 to the bakery for each loaf it buys. They estimate that when loaves are turned into sandwiches and sold, the revenue attributed to each loaf is $1.50. Any bread unsold at the end of a day is worthless. Assume that all probability distributions are normal.</p>
