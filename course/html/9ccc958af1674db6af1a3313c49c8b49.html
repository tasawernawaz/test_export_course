<p style="font-size: 16px;">Bobby receives a gift for his tenth birthday &mdash; a model car. The model car has three compo- nents, which we call A, B, and C. Unfortunately, Bobby does not like the gift and consequently uses it for target practice. He throws rocks at the model car with the goal of destroying it as soon as possible. (When the car is finished, he will start destroying his other unsatisfactory gifts. Darling child.)</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">For any given throw, the probability that that the rock hits Component A is \(\pi_A\) = 0.1, the probability that it hits Component B is \(\pi_B\) = 0.2, and the probability that it hits Component C is \(\pi_C\) = 0.3. These events are independent of one another and of the condition of the car.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">For example, whether or not Component A is hit by the first rock, it will still be hit by the second rock with probability 0.1.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Once a component is hit by a rock, that component will stop working. The car will be broken once Component A stops working&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">or</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&nbsp;both</strong></span>&nbsp;Components B and C stop working.</p>
