<p>In this week, we will be introducing MATLAB to solve Practice Problems and Graded Problems. Specifically, we will be running an m-file via MATLAB Online, which solves for the production rate and average inventory of a deterministic two-machine line. Below is the list of inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>Inputs:</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li>\(r_1\): Repair rate of machine 1, also known as \(\frac{1}{MTTR_1}\)</li>
<li>\(p_1\): Failure rate of machine 1,&nbsp;also known as \(\frac{1}{MTTF_1}\)</li>
<li>\(r_2\): Repair rate of machine 2, also known as \(\frac{1}{MTTR_2}\)</li>
<li>\(p_2\): Failure&nbsp;rate of machine 2, also known as \(\frac{1}{MTTF_2}\)</li>
<li>\(N\): Buffer size</li>
</ol></ol></ol>
<p>Outputs:</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li>prodrate: Production rate of the line</li>
<li>\(\bar{n}\): Average buffer level</li>
</ol></ol></ol>
<p>Please review instructional video below on how to use this interface.</p>
