<h4>Optimization</h4>
<p>This script will function just like the desktop version of Matlab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to complete the Practice Problem 2 and Graded Problem 2, we suggest users to think about clever ways of guessing \(N\) to arrive at the optimal solution.</p>
<p>For those who are more adept at Matlab, you can just run a for loop with a reasonable range for N, to find the optimal value.</p>
<p>For those of you who are familiar with the Optimization Toolbox, feel free to use fminbnd, or anything else you are familiar with.</p>
