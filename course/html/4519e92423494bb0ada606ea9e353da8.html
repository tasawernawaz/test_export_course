<h3><span class="fa fa-bolt"><span class="sr">Lightning Bolt icon</span></span>  <b>Clarification!!</b></h3>

<p>Near the end of this video at 8:21, we show a graph of the sample path over t = 5000 units. Then at 9:07, we show an animation of the same queuing system over the same window of time that shows a <i>different</i> path (with maximum queue larger than the maximum queue showed in the graph).</p>

<p>The graph and the animation show two different runs of the <i>same</i> queueing system. The difference between these two paths is that they had <i>different</i> seeds.  We want to show that although both graphs have the same average values (and other statistical measures), their detailed values can be very different.</p>

<p>We show the static graph so that you are encouraged to look closely at the queue values at any point in the time of interest, and we show the animation so that you may have an intuitive sense of how the system behaves dynamically.</p>
