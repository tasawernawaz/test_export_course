<p>Figure 2 shows the transition graph of a four-state continuous time Markov process. It represents the behavior of a machine that has three failure modes. U represents the operational (up) state and 1, 2, and 3 represents the three failure modes. When the machine is in state U, it produces at rate \(\mu\); when it is in a down state, it does not produce.</p>
<p>When the machine is in state U, it makes a transition to state i at failure rate \(p_i; i = 1, 2, 3\). (That is, the probability of it being in i at time \(t +\delta t\) given that it was in state U at time t is very close to \(p_i t\) if \(\delta t\) is very small.) When the machine is in state \(i; i = 1, 2, 3\), it goes to state U at repair rate \(r_i\). No other transitions are possible. In answering the questions below, if you find it convenient to replace U by 4, feel free to do so.</p>
<p>\(p_1=0.001, p_2=0.005, p_3=0.1\)</p>
<p>\(r_1=0.1, r_2=0.15, r_3=0.05\)</p>
<p>\(\mu\)=2 parts/time unit</p>
