<p>The management of the EE-Cole-Eye Sandwich Truck could not find a fast enough sandwich maker, so they changed their business strategy: they found a vacant store they could afford and opened the EE-Cole-Eye Sandwich Shop. Unfortunately, they could only afford a very small space: there was only room for 4 people to wait in line in the shop. Figure 3 shows the transition graph for the number of customers in the shop. The inter-arrival time and the sandwich-making time are exponentially distributed.</p>
