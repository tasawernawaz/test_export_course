<p>Consider an engine line that normally produces \(A\) engines per 8-hour working day during a month of 20 working days. These engines are sent to a final assembly plant that makes \(A\) cars per day on average.</p>
<p>Suppose during one month the assembly plant makes \(A-\Delta A\) cars every odd numbered day and \(A+\Delta A\) every even numbered day.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are \(W\) production line workers at the engine plant and their labor cost (including overhead) is $80/hr/worker for regular hours and $120/hr/worker for overtime. Suppose also that there is nothing else for a worker to do on a regular day when the daily quota is reached before 8 hours, but the company still have to pay the worker for a full day.</p>
<p>Let \(A=100\), \(\Delta A=10\) and \(W=60\).</p>
