<p>Consider two queueing systems.</p>
<p>The first has one server and no limit on the length of the queue. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\). The service time is exponentially distributed with rate \(\mu_k\). \(\mu_k\) is proportional to the number of people in the queue. That is, where \(k\) is the number of people in the queue and \(\mu\) is a constant.</p>
<p>\(\mu_k=ku\)</p>
<p>\(\lambda=1.5\)</p>
<p>\(\mu=1.6\)</p>
