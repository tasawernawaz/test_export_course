<p>Three white balls and three black balls are distributed between urns A and B in such a way that each urn contains exactly three balls. One ball is drawn at random and simultaneously from each urn; these two balls are then placed in the other urn. This action is repeated many times. We are interested in describing how the number of black and white balls in each urn behaves.</p>
<p>Below is the transition diagram.</p>
