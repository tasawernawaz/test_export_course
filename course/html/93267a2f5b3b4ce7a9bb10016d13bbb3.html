<p style="font-size: 16px;">This problem is about some of the costs and benefits of frequent inspection of parts. It evaluates the removal of defective parts from the flow of material so that no further work is done on a part if it is found to be defective.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">It starts with simple systems and adds features until it reaches the analysis we want. In Part 1&nbsp;there is only one machine and no inspection. In Part 2 there are two machines, but there is no inspection after the first operation, so all parts go through both machines. In Parts&nbsp;3 and 4 inspection takes place after the first of two machines and parts that fail inspection at the first machine leave the line with no further processing. Part&nbsp;3 asks you to determine the average value of all parts (both good and bad) that leave a two-machine production line and Part&nbsp;4 asks for the cost increases or decreases due to inspection.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">All costs and values are measured in dollars. We assume that these quantities have been provided by the company's accounting department.</p>
