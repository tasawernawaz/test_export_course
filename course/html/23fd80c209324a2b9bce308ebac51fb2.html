<p>You are a manufacturing engineer for the Megatronics Manufacturing Company and you must design a transfer line.</p>
<p>To make a certain metal part, called an axle pin, you must do four machining operations, called A, B, C, and D, in the order indicated. The times required for these operations are 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 6 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively, and never vary. Megatronics is considering building a transfer line to make axle pins, but they can only use systems that operate at a fixed, common cycle time, even when there are buffers. (Here, by cycle time we mean the time between operations.) This cycle time must be the longest operation time of any of the machines. That is, if you build a four-machine, three buffer line, the cycle time would have to be 6 minutes, and machines A, B, and D would be idle 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 1 minute each cycle, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>reliability:</strong></span> Machines have operation-dependent failures. Assume that the mean time between failures for each operation A, B, C, D is 5 hours of working time, and that the mean repair time is 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">inventory cost:</span></strong> Assume a cost of $1000 for each part in a buffer. Assume that all buffers have size 3 or greater.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">demand:</span> </strong>Parts must be produced at a long range average rate of 7 parts per hour.</p>
