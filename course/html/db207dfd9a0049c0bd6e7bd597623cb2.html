<p style="font-size: 16px;">The Tech Manufacturing Company is contemplating the acquisition of a transfer line to make digital adapters for its highly successful Tech- o-Tronic brand of multi-frequency desktop widgets.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The making of widget adapters is a multi-step process. It requires rough drilling, finished reaming. Different vendors have been invited to submit bids for the machines and buffers that will make up the line.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Your assignment is to design a the least expensive line</strong>&nbsp;(the line with the least expensive combination of machines and buffers)&nbsp;<strong>that produces widgets at a required production rate of 56 parts per hour.</strong>&nbsp;You must determine which of the following machines should the company purchase, and what size buffers should it use, to minimize the cost of the line.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The following is a summary of the information supplied by the vendors. Operating rates (operations per minute) are the rates that machines can do operations when they are not under repair, not starved, and not blocked.</p>
