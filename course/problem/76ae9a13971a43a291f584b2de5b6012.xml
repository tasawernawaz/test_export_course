    <p>Using the DET2TL program, recommend the cheapest configuration of a two-machine deterministic processing time line. The demand on the system requires a long run production rate of .53 parts per minute. </p>
    <p>Consider a design with machines that have 1 minute operation times. We have a choice of two models for the first machine: \(M_{11}\) has (r; p) = (.01, .008) and a price of $10,000; \(M_{12}\) has (r; p) = (.01, .006) and a price of $20,000. There is only one model available for the second machine, \(M_2\), and its parameters are (r; p) = (.01, .006) and its price is $20,000. </p>
    <p>To avoid complicated financial issues like depreciation and taxation, we will evaluate the cost of a line as the sum of the purchase prices of the machines and the value of the average number of parts in the buffer. Assume that the value of a part is $50.</p>
    <label>What is the least expensive design of the line that has a production rate
of .53 parts per minute?</label>
