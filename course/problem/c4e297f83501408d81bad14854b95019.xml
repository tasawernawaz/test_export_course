        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>In push systems, the control information flow is in the same direction of goods flow whereas in pull systems the direction opposes the direction of flow (each step responds to the step that follows it). Thus, push systems are less adaptable to fluctuations in the system and generally lead to larger inventory when the system experiences fluctuations. Instead of scheduling coming from a central location in a push system, scheduling is comes from its following step in a pull system.</p>
