      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 1em;">
          <p> The average waiting time in the queue is given by \(W_{q} = \frac{L_{q}}{\lambda} = \frac{5}{12}\) (min)</p>
          <p/>
          <p> The average waiting time in the system includes the average waiting time in the queue and the process
            time. Therefore, we have</p>
          <p>
            \(W = W_{q} + \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{L_{q}}{\lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{2}{15} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{5}(hr) = 12 (min)\)
