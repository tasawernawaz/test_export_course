    <solution>
      <div class="detailed-solution">
        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>MTTF=(3000 parts) x (2 minutes/part) = 6000 minutes = 100 hours</p>
        <p>MTTR=7 hours</p>
        <p>\(\tau\) = 2 minutes</p>
        <p>Production rate = \( \frac{1}{\tau}(\frac{MTTF}{MTTF+MTTR})=\frac{1}{2}\frac{100}{100+7}=0.467\) parts per minute</p>
        <p>Time to make 24,000 parts is \(24000/.467=51360\) minutes or 856 hours</p>
