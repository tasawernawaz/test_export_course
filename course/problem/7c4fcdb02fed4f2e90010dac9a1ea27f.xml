  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>On odd days the engine plant produces A and the assembly plant takes \(A-\Delta A\). On those days the inventory is \(\Delta A\). On even days, the engine plant produces A and the assembly plant takes \(A+\Delta A\), so the inventory goes to 0. Therefore, the average inventory is \(\Delta A/2\).

  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The daily average cost is just 8*80*\(W\).</p>
