      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 1em;">
          Note that the arrival rate exceeds the service rate during some intervals. This is not a problem since the lengths of the intervals are finite. The queue length grows during such periods. The service rate is always 2 per minute. During the periods when the arrival rate is less than 2, we can approximate the system as an M/M/1 queue in steady state. The average queue length is then λ/(2 − λ).
