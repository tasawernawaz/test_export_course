        <p>We explain in stages. 1) After the M2 valve closes for a short-time, B1 remains full and B2 will drop in level a small amount. 2) When M1 and M3 are closed, the water levels will switch and B1 will drop in level a small amount and B2 will be full. 3) When only M1 remains closed, B1 will lower in water level while B2 remains the same.
