    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>First, \(\lambda_{12}=\lambda_{23}=\lambda_{34}=0.1 \), \(\lambda_{41}=0.5 \).</p>
      <ul>  
        </ul>
      <p>To determine \(\lambda_{14} \), note that the rate the machine leaves state 1 (given it is in state 1) is \(\lambda_{14}+\lambda_{12}\) (since it leaves when the first of the two exit processes occurs). The probability that it goes to state 4 during \([t, \delta t]\) given that it leaves state 1 during \([t, \delta t]\) is</p>
      <p>\(\frac{\lambda_{14}\delta t}{(\lambda_{14}+\lambda_{12})\delta t}=\frac{\lambda_{14}}{(\lambda_{14}+\lambda_{12})}=0.001\) </p>
      <p>Therefore, \(\lambda_{14} \) represents 0.1% of the probability of leaving state 1 and \(\lambda_{12} \) represents 99.9% of the probability of leaving state 1.</p>
      <p>Thus, \(\lambda_{14}=\lambda_{12}/999 \).</p>
      <p>Similarily, \(\lambda_{24}=\lambda_{23}/9 \).</p>
