  <p><b>Assuming the same conditions are still in place from part 2</b>. Suppose the second machine fails 40 minutes into the hour, every hour for 10 minutes. </p>
  <label>Assuming the Kanban size is now 2, and the buffer is empty at time 0. How many parts are produced in the first hour?</label>

    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Time 1-10: 9 parts produced</p>
      <p>Time 11-20: 1 part produced, Machine 1 is down, there is 1 part in Machine 2.</p>
      <p>Time 21-30: 9 parts produced, system is starting up again with nothing in the system.</p>
      <p>Time 31-40: 10 parts produced, both machines are up.</p>
      <p>Time 41-50: 0 part produced, machine 2 is down, nothing leaves the system.</p>
      <p>Time 51-60: 10 parts, machine 2 is back up, and immediately have a part to work on.</p>

  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Time 1-10: 10 parts produced, machine two has part to work on at the start of the 2nd hour.</p>
      <p>Time 11-20: 10 part produced, Machine 1 is down, there is 1 part in machine 2 and 9 parts in the buffer.</p>
      <p>Time 21-30: 9 parts produced, system is starting up again with nothing in the system.</p>
      <p>Time 31-40: 10 parts produced, both machines are up.</p>
      <p>Time 41-50: 0 part produced, machine 2 is down, nothing leaves the system.</p>
      <p>Time 51-60: 10 parts, machine 2 is back up, and immediately have a part to work on.</p>
