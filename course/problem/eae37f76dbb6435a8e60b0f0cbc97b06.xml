      <div class="detailed-solution">
        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>Use Newsboy model:</p>
        <p>Cost per day:\(c=\frac{4000}{365}=10.96\) ($/day)</p>
        <p>Revenue per day:\(r=30\) ($/day)</p>
        <p>Salvage value per day:\(s=0\) ($/day)</p>
        <p>Demand \(d\) is Poisson distributed with mean 60.</p>
        <p>\(P(d\leq Q) \geq \frac{r-c}{r-s}=0.6347\)</p>
        <p>When \(Q=62\), \(P(d\leq Q)=0.63381\)</p>
