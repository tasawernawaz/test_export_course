        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>The binomial distribution is the sum of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables. For one coin toss, you would only need a Bernoulli distribution as there are only two possible outcomes. The geometric distribution is not appropriate because you would be modeling the latest time you expect to see one outcome.</p>
