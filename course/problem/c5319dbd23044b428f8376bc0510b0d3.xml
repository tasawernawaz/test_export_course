    <p>Return to the situation described in Question 1. Suppose that Youngjae decided not to
work on a part in FIFO order but in random order. That is, if Youngjae finishes a process
and finds two parts waiting, he will chose between the two parts at random, i.e., each waiting
part will have probability 0.5 of being the next one to be processed. </p>
    <description>In which of the two cases, if any, will W time be greater? (W is the expected total amount of time that a part has to spend in the milling area.) </description>
