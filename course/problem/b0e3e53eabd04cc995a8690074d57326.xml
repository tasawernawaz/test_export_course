        <p>A part is produced as often as all the machines are operational. We assume that if any machine fails, the line stops. This is certainly correct if there is a mechanism that shuts the whole line when any machine fails. If not, the formulas we derive may not be exactly correct. For example, the machines downstream of the failure can still work if there are parts in those machines and the transfer mechanism keeps operating. Those machines can do productive work until those parts leave the system. However, if that happens, some or all of the machines downstream of the failure will have no parts at the time that that machine is repaired. For that reason, those machines will be idle after the repair for the same length of time as they were working after the failure. </p>
